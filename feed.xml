        <title>Count Biki - Drill Japanese Numbers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m proud to present my latest iOS app, Count Biki.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-icon.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Count Biki app icon&quot; title=&quot;Count Biki app icon&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Count Biki app icon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’ll talk about the background of the app, go over a few high level implementation details, and then share what may be next for the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese learners can download the app from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/count-biki/id6463796779&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many of my other apps, Count Biki is open source on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/count-biki&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Counting to ten is one of the first things we learn in a foreign language. Each language has its own rules about how numbers combine to form larger numbers, how they combine with objects, and how they associate with the concept of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first moved to Japan, every couple shops or restaurants I’d visit wouldn’t have a display at the cash register. The cashier would speak my 4 or 5 digit total aloud at native speed and I’d be lucky to get the first digit. I’d panic and fumble through the transaction, then forget about it until the next time. It was tough skill to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese has unique readings for days of the month, e.g. July 1st, October 9th, etc. We learn them in the 101-level course, but in daily conversation I’d rarely need to enumerate each ordinal. The knowledge gracefully slipped away as it usually does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to now, and there are more language learning apps than ever. Even ones that help with numbers. However, I wanted a more streamlined way to practice all types of numbers, and I wanted to focus on Japanese and ensure I could practice the uniquely difficult parts of the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In cases like dealing with money, the numbers are essentially random. Therefore, I didn’t want to rely on just hard coding a couple dozen entries. Computers are great at:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generating random numbers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generating speech from text&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generating spelled out text from numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;planning&quot;&gt;Planning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a big list of every number-adjacent concept in the language and the different modes I wanted to practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-enumerating-concepts.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Brainstorming which topics I could cover and how I could test them&quot; title=&quot;Brainstorming which topics I could cover and how I could test them&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Brainstorming which topics I could cover and how I could test them&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a bit overwhelming at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a bit of prototyping in a Swift Playground to figure out which of Apple’s APIs – speech recognition, numeral-to-text transliteration – were feasible to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-swift-playground-prototyping.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Starting in Swift Playgrounds to test out the system APIs&quot; title=&quot;Starting in Swift Playgrounds to test out the system APIs&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Starting in Swift Playgrounds to test out the system APIs&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to start with the flow of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;generate a random number&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;speak the number out loud&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the user types the number on a 10-key keyboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first sketches looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-sketch-home.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;The first UI sketch in my notebook&quot; title=&quot;The first UI sketch in my notebook&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The first UI sketch in my notebook&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prototyping&quot;&gt;Prototyping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the first prototype looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-first-prototype.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;The first prototype&quot; title=&quot;The first prototype&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The first prototype&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made a fun little animated barber pole to imply that review sessions were infinite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/count-biki-animated-barber-pole.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/count-biki-animated-barber-pole-poster.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And cleaned up the design a little bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-second-prototype.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;450&quot; alt=&quot;The cleaned up prototype&quot; title=&quot;The cleaned up prototype&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The cleaned up prototype&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-an-original-character&quot;&gt;Designing an original character&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed in the top right corner of the above sketch, there’s a little character I marked “the count”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-sketch-the-count.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;A sketch of The Count&quot; title=&quot;A sketch of The Count&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A sketch of The Count&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to riff on Duolingo’s use of characters to motivate the learner and keep the app lighthearted. Duolingo &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.duolingo.com/world-character-visemes/&quot;&gt;uses a tool&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=&quot;https://rive.app/&quot;&gt;Rive&lt;/a&gt; (although I didn’t know this at the time). I’ve been dabbling in &lt;a href=&quot;https://blender.org&quot;&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; for 3D modeling for the last few years, so I thought I’d experiment with creating a 3D modeled character and animating it with Apple’s native SceneKit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this little maneuver set me back a couple weeks 😅. And to be clear, adding an animated character to the app was way more of an “I’m interested in learning something new” rather than “the app will be useless without this feature”. However, this did make naming and branding and making an icon for the app way easier!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animated-character-proof-of-concept&quot;&gt;Animated character proof of concept&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before spending an awful lot of time perfecting a character and its animations, I wanted to get a proof of concept working that covered the entire use case end-to-end, namely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a 3D-character model&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;textured with either physically-based shaders or UV-unwrapping on a bitmap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;rigged with at least one bone&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;with multiple animations defined in Blender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;with lighting and a camera&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exportable from Blendeer and importable with Xcode&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;displayable in a SceneView in SwiftUI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;triggering each animation on demand from a SwiftUI button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of new concepts for me! Some of the Blender tasks I’d done once or twice under the guidance of random YouTube tutorials, but the SceneKit integration was completely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by modeling a character with only 3 objects, UV-unwrapping him, and painting the texture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-proto-modeling.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Modeling and UV-unwrapping the prototype character&quot; title=&quot;Modeling and UV-unwrapping the prototype character&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Modeling and UV-unwrapping the prototype character&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I rigged him with a single bone and added 3 animations (doing my best to understand the NLA editor was).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-proto-animation.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Rigging and animating the prototype character&quot; title=&quot;Rigging and animating the prototype character&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Rigging and animating the prototype character&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the “you got the question incorrect” animation rendered out of Blender for reference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-proto-incorrect.mp4&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-proto-incorrect-poster.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was probably the hardest part of the entire process: the exporting/importing dance. Like &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/979/&quot;&gt;DenverCoder9&lt;/a&gt;, I found only a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/79321?answerId=751657022#751657022&quot;&gt;few faint traces&lt;/a&gt; on the internet of how I’d go about getting both a model and its separate animations out of Blender and into SceneKit. I naively followed the instructions from the thread, made some tweaks to the SceneKit file, tweaked the camera and lighting, mocked out a SwiftUI view with some buttons, and the result was:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-proto-swiftui.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-proto-swiftui-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the animations were more subdued in app version than they were in the Blender version. I wasn’t sure why, but I decided to move on since it was a gamble of whether the subtle differences in the production version of the model would surface the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animated-character-production-version&quot;&gt;Animated character production version&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I had a working proof of concept, it was time to do the hard work of actually designing the real character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I did a short interlude of powering through a few character modeling and animation tutorials on YouTube. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTWV67qUX2k&quot;&gt;This long tutorial&lt;/a&gt; from Imphenzia was particularly influential and useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many ideas, I can’t say exactly where or when all the parts of the Count Biki branding came to me. I knew I wanted to riff on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_von_Count&quot;&gt;Count von Count&lt;/a&gt; character from Sesame Street. However, I also wanted to incorporate Japanese counters. I always thought 匹 (ひき hiki), the small animals counter was kind of cute sounding. The version for 3 small animals is pronounced biki (びき).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why a rabbit? I can’t remember for sure, but the ironic part is that rabbits are traditionally &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; counted with 匹 (ひき hiki), but 羽 (わ wa) due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-wa/#rabbits&quot;&gt;rumored historical reasons&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, a cute, vampiric rabbit felt like a unique take.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some Dribbble hunting for references and mood board creation, did a few sketches (that are much too embarrassing to post publicly), then began 3D modeling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt was… not great. Luckily, a few friends gave some very useful feedback and my next iteration was much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-first-render.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Revised model of Count Biki&quot; title=&quot;Revised model of Count Biki&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Revised model of Count Biki&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I specifically modeled Biki sitting so I could simplify the rig. Rigging, or adding virtual bones that stretch the polygons and are easier to animate, was my next step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t emphasize enough how complex rigging is. It may seem like an afterthought, but it’s an entire division at 3D studios, and for good reason. Below is Biki’s humble rig showing his suit in weight painting mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-rig.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Biki with his rig bones visible&quot; title=&quot;Biki with his rig bones visible&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Biki with his rig bones visible&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that in place, I moved on to the animation part. Even though I’d never done keyframe animation in Blender for a 3D character before, getting the basics done felt surprisingly natural to me. This was probably the most fun part of the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-animation.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Animating Biki one keyframe at a time&quot; title=&quot;Animating Biki one keyframe at a time&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Animating Biki one keyframe at a time&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final result for the “you got the answer correct” animation looked like this straight out of Blender:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-animation-correct.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/count-biki-blender-animation-correct-poster.png&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the model and animations out of Blender… this part was dreadful. I tried so hard to use Apple’s newest, most blessed workflow of USDZ, but some combination of the Blender exporter and the Xcode importer made this impossible. In the end, I used the same combination of one DAE (Collada) file with just the model and armature, and one DAE file per animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imported the model file into Xcode, creating a new SceneKit scene, then painstakingly re-added the camera, lights, and materials, all of which look and work differently (read: worse) in SceneKit than they do in Blender. I couldn’t get Biki to look as clean in the app as he does in Blender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/count-biki-model-scn.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Biki moved into his new home in an SCN file&quot; title=&quot;Biki moved into his new home in an SCN file&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Biki moved into his new home in an SCN file&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I exported the animations next. When playing them back in the app, I found that some polygons on the suit were getting caught during the animation. This was somewhat expected due to my inexperience modeling and rigging and weight painting. I powered my way through these issues and ended up with the final result: Biki in the test app, playing his idle animation and reacting to questions being answered right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/count-biki-test-app-demo.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/count-biki-test-app-demo-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;800&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

        <title>Goalie - A Bespoke macOS App for Time Tracking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I self-released a bespoke time tracking app for macOS called Goalie in July 2023. I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/goalie&quot;&gt;open sourced&lt;/a&gt; it. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-main.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; alt=&quot;Today view&quot; title=&quot;Today view&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Today view&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the latest version directly from the GitHub &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/goalie/releases&quot;&gt;releases page&lt;/a&gt; if you want to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I’ll give some background behind the app and a discuss a few notes about the implementation, and talk about how I created the icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created Goalie as my first bite-sized project after &lt;a href=&quot;/2023/10/18/cookpad-retrospective/&quot;&gt;leaving Cookpad&lt;/a&gt; at the end of June 2023. Since I’d no longer be immersed in the Japanese language at the office every day, I wanted to make sure I was putting in a fair amount of time studying Japanese on my own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could have used one of a million time tracking apps focused on invoicing or Pomodoro, or even macOS’s built-in Screen Time feature. But this felt like a great opportunity to make a focused piece of software to my own specifications. I also wanted to do a SwiftUI-based macOS app to see where the framework was currently at. My past experience and impression from reading other developers’ thoughts was that SwiftUI on macOS has always significantly lagged behind iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-and-stop-the-timer&quot;&gt;Start and stop the timer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-main.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; alt=&quot;Today view&quot; title=&quot;Today view&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Today view&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clicking start starts a new “session”. Stopping ends the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you reach your daily goal, the goal button lights up green.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optionally-set-a-goal&quot;&gt;Optionally set a goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-set-goal.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; alt=&quot;Goal view&quot; title=&quot;Goal view&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Goal view&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the goal button and drag the slider to set your daily goal. Changing the goal sets the goal from that day forward until you change it again. It doesn’t affect past goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-and-edit-daily-sessions&quot;&gt;Show and edit daily sessions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-main-expanded.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; alt=&quot;Today view with sessions expanded&quot; title=&quot;Today view with sessions expanded&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Today view with sessions expanded&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the “sessions today” button to show other sessions from the day. If you want to remove one, click the “x” button to its left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;show-history&quot;&gt;Show history&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-history.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; alt=&quot;History view&quot; title=&quot;History view&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;History view&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click the calendar to show a weekly summary of your goal. Click the arrows in the header to page back through the history by weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goalie targets the SwiftUI 4 APIs (i.e. macOS 13, iOS 16).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with a vanilla SwiftUI architecture that separates the view and store. The one new thing I wanted to try was pointfreeco’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-dependencies&quot;&gt;swift-dependencies&lt;/a&gt; library to control my dependency layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this kind of app is often implemented as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/the-menu-bar#Menu-bar-extras&quot;&gt;menu bar extra&lt;/a&gt;, I preferred a simple app window I can keep off to the corner of my big monitor. My menu bar is already too full. As an app window I can keep it in my peripheral vision or hide it behind other windows easily. If I were to formally release this app for a more general audience, I’d probably add a menu bar extra though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used a ViewData abstraction to encapsulate some of the simple synchronous logic that turns raw model data into properties ready for the view to display directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For styling, I tried to use UIKit system colors and font styles as best I could to get a classic look and dark mode support. I picked a bluish purple for the tint color. I kept branding to an absolute minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For persistence, I made my model layer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/code&gt; and save it to the application support directory. The app currently only supports one “topic”, but I’ve left the door open to make it a proper document-based app that allows having multiple topics going at the same time. At the moment that goes beyond my personal use case, so I haven’t explored it any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dates-and-times&quot;&gt;Dates and times&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dates and times and calendars are well known to &lt;a href=&quot;https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time&quot;&gt;cause headaches&lt;/a&gt; for developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even for what I considered to be as close to a trivial time tracking code as one could write, I still immediately ran into gotchas. Especially when I went to write the history code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think any time you start to divide hours up into days with a beginning and end, you’ve got use a calendar and time zones, of which there are many. When you want to divide days up into weeks, the problems compound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t help that many of Apple’s underlying APIs for calendars silently use the user’s current locale and more specific localization settings under the hood. This usually great, but makes it incredibly difficult to introduce complexity to your codebase slowly, and also easily test each locale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I made significant use of the new Foundation formatter APIs, which, in theory, wield like a Swiss Army Knife. But in practice, there’s no official documentation, the source is completely obscured by the heavy use of generics, and you still need detailed background knowledge of how the several dozen locales affect the results. Luckily &lt;a href=&quot;https://goshdarnformatstyle.com/&quot;&gt;Gosh Darn Format Style!&lt;/a&gt; helped take some of the edge off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// An example of calculating and displaying the duration of an ongoing session:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;startOfDay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;calendar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;startOfDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Enumerates all sessions to calculate the total number of seconds logged for the current day up to now.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;totalIntervalToday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;totalIntervalBetween&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;startOfDay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Convert to `Duration` type for formatting.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;seconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;totalIntervalToday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Produces something like 02:15:12 for a number of seconds.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// (This should probably explicitly reference `locale`).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;formatted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; 
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hourMinuteSecond&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;padHourToLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;fractionalSecondsLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; 
                &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;roundFractionalSeconds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;up&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this all means is that this code is unfortunately not well tested in all locales, which is the main reason I haven’t pushed for a wide release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-modeling&quot;&gt;Data modeling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to model a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/code&gt; (the highest level model) as such:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Topic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// non-nil when a session is active&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;activeSessionStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// assume sorted past to future&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sessions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IdentifiedArrayOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// assume sorted past to future, no two goals on the same day&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;goals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IdentifiedArrayOf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data is relatively normalized in that I have to parse it a bit to configure the view layer. Let me show the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Session&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/code&gt; models before explaining further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Session&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// always normalized to the start of a day (this has known issues with time zone changing)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt; 

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// nil intentionally unsets a goal, always &amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TimeInterval&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main consequence of logging only the start and end date of a session instead of updating the model to count up seconds is that the SwiftUI view updates independently from the model using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TimelineView&lt;/code&gt; primitive. If the computer is put to sleep or hidden, there won’t be any error in the model timekeeping. A downside is that using TimelineView offloads some necessary logic to the view layer, especially with date formatting. It’s a trade off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This setup generally uses the least amount of data necessary to capture the full state and history of the system. I calculate the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/code&gt; moving forward in time indefinitely or until the next &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/code&gt; object is logged. This adds some calculation burden, but it more efficient in storage. Of course, if users were allowed to, for example, insert a new goal for just one day, it would make that insertion logic slightly more complicated in the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving the user-can-move-time-zones problem is tough enough that I haven’t bothered. There are a couple UX questions about the “correct” behavior that aren’t immediately obvious to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;start-of-day&quot;&gt;Start of day&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept of “start of the current day” is important since the count up timer is always calculated based on that point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought macOS would have some sort of globally posted notification for when the day rolls over, but I couldn’t find one. One lingering issue is that my workaround code for updating that very important start-of-day value wasn’t running reliably. I’m much more familiar with the iOS app lifecycle than the macOS lifecycle so it’s unclear to me whether it’s an alarm setting error on my part, or whether the app just isn’t firing the alarm and updating the date when it’s not the key window. Either way, I added a workaround in v1.0.1 to simply ensure the start-of-day value is updated when the window is foregrounded. I recognize it’s not a perfect fix, but one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deployment&quot;&gt;Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t set up fastlane, CI, or even Xcodegen for this project. But it’s surprisingly straightforward to do your own manual app build, signing, and distribution through GitHub. Next on the list would be a proper App Store release or Sparkle integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designing-the-icon&quot;&gt;Designing the icon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was initially tempted to use Stable Diffusion to create a low-effort app icon. However, lately I’ve been dabbling in 3D modeling with Blender and I decided to see how far I could get using it to create an icon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-icon.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;App icon&quot; title=&quot;App icon&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;App icon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out, pretty far! I actually like this icon a lot and it didn’t take so long to put together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to log some more hours on it, I’d make it give it more of a macOS vibe by removing the heavy white border and try overhanging some of the foreground elements. Also I’d make some more custom low-res versions. Overall though, I find it easy to recognize in my dock when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some more WIP shots of the design process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-icon-design-01.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Modeling the goal&quot; title=&quot;Modeling the goal&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Modeling the goal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-icon-design-02.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;The grass and camera position&quot; title=&quot;The grass and camera position&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;The grass and camera position&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/goalie-icon-design-03.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Setting up the shaders&quot; title=&quot;Setting up the shaders&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Setting up the shaders&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This app has been working well for me over the past month or two. It’s been great having some extra time to make some scratch-your-own-itch apps. There are plenty of ways I could improve the app, but for now, I’m satisfied with where it’s at and hope it continues to serve me well.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cookpad: A Retrospective</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been almost 5 years since my last series of posts, and 8 since &lt;a href=&quot;/2015/11/03/timehop-a-retrospective/&quot;&gt;Timehop: A Retrospective&lt;/a&gt;. As my last day as an iOS engineer at Cookpad was June 30th, 2023, it’s time to start another chapter of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I only published publicly twice on the Cookpad developer blog (&lt;a href=&quot;https://techlife.cookpad.com/entry/2019/06/14/160000&quot;&gt;Working with AWS AppSync on iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://techlife.cookpad.com/entry/2023/06/21/162523&quot;&gt;Path Drawing in SwiftUI&lt;/a&gt;), on our company internal blog I wrote nearly 90 posts, including tutorial videos and recorded presentations. At the time I knew I’d regret publishing internally only, but the ease of writing for a known audience was too hard to break from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next phase, I’ll be making up for lost time. However, for the moment, I’ll try to recap the last ~6 years at Cookpad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked in some capacity in 7 departments at Cookpad over my tenure, mostly as an iOS engineer, but also in and around AR, IoT, hardware, and ML. From my perspective, management at Cookpad was always encouraging of inter-company movement of engineers, even at smaller scales like 2-3 months (“study abroad”). I certainly appreciated these opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For context, I worked for Cookpad remotely from Chicago for Cookpad Japan for 6 months starting in April 2017. I moved to Japan in October 2017 and have lived here since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cookpad-global&quot;&gt;Cookpad Global&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started off on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cookpad-find-share-recipes/id585332633&quot;&gt;Cookpad Global&lt;/a&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Global I learned of the complexities of supporting a fully internationalized app, especially in the era where Apple’s support for things like right-to-left languages was still primitive. I learned how intentional distributed work must be while working with groups in the UK and Japan from both Chicago and Japan. I re-learned that premature scaling (choose your preferred definition of “premature” and “scaling”) is perhaps the most irrecoverable mistake startups can make. I continued to refine and put into practice my ideas about unidirectional architecture, immutable view models, and the tradeoffs of functional reactive systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a unique team where I worked closely with teammates from dozens of nationalities and cultures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My three biggest (non-solo) projects were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Converting our app’s navigation layer to use the nascent coordinator pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rewriting our recipe editor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rewriting our login module to support region switching, new OAuth services, and Apple’s new Safari APIs specifically for login.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;studio-satellite&quot;&gt;Studio Satellite&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next was &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cookpad-studio/id1464118207&quot;&gt;Cookpad Studio Satellite&lt;/a&gt;, a startup project within the Cookpad TV organization with a team of around 5. Our goal was to make an app where any cook could easily shoot and edit their own quick-cut recipe video from their iPhone. In later stages pre-launch, we even bolted on a social network that included all the mainstays: a feed, likes, comments, profiles, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/cookpad-studio-satellite.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Video editor timeline of a pre-release version of Cookpad Studio Satellite&quot; title=&quot;Video editor timeline of a pre-release version of Cookpad Studio Satellite&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Video editor timeline of a pre-release version of Cookpad Studio Satellite&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this project I learned that I love prototyping, working on zero-to-one ideas, working with small teams, and having input (whether true or imagined) into the full product development process. I learned that there will always be stakeholders and that check will always come due.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned that sometimes your first users aren’t who you originally thought they’d be. Specifically: we had a dedicated group of community managers from the Global division beta testing from the early versions of the app and giving us very detailed feedback, and yet we never treated them as our “real” users, instead sticking to our original plan of eventually launching to more traditional Cookpad users. It’s speculation, but with some hindsight, I think those community managers could have a been the perfect group to seed the app to and grow from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interlude-wwdc-2019&quot;&gt;Interlude: WWDC 2019&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I attended WWDC for the first time 2019 with a small group of iOS engineers from Cookpad Japan and Cookpad Global. It turned out to be a massive year: iOS 13, SwiftUI, Combine, UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource, dark mode, etc. And it was also the final year of the “classic” in-person WWDC format before COVID19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;oicy-smart-kitchen&quot;&gt;OiCy (Smart Kitchen)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During a transitional period, I built a one-off app for the Smart Kitchen team. Our team used the app to present a concept during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://smartkitchensummit.mars.bindcloud.jp/food-innovation.co/sksj2019/index.html&quot;&gt;Smart Kitchen Summit Japan 2019&lt;/a&gt; conference. From concept to presenting the fully functioning app at the conference, it was less than 2 weeks. The app interfaced with a connected oven, inductive cooktop, condiment dispenser, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thespoon.tech/cookpad-has-100m-active-monthly-users-broadens-into-original-hardware-design-with-a-hard-soft-water-device/&quot;&gt;variable hardness water dispenser&lt;/a&gt;, and was remote controlled via the Multipeer Connectivity framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/cookpad-oicy-sksj-2019-presentation.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;A video still from the OiCy Smart Kitchen Summit Japan 2019 presentation showing a hardware-integrated recipe app prototype.&quot; title=&quot;A video still from the OiCy Smart Kitchen Summit Japan 2019 presentation showing a hardware-integrated recipe app prototype.&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;A video still from the OiCy Smart Kitchen Summit Japan 2019 presentation showing a hardware-integrated recipe app prototype.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through the unique scope of this project – a one-off demo app used for a conference presentation – I learned how to radically tailor my development style to some given constraints. It can be surprisingly difficult to choose between development techniques that I know well and work well for 1M+ user-facing apps, and hacky techniques that get the prototype shipped by the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, the presentation was a success, but the smart kitchen division closed down a year or so later in late 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;rd&quot;&gt;R&amp;amp;D&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the R&amp;amp;D division with a remit to prototype and productionize various R&amp;amp;D technologies under active research by our team of 5-10. I shipped an MVP that integrated image recognition into an app flow to estimate calories. This was another project that was developed and released internally within a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next big project was using image recognition to filter food photos in the main Cookpad’s recipe photo picker. The main challenges were converting the machine learning model to Core ML and doing all processing transparently on device as a background task for potentially hundreds of thousands of photos. The feature was released for a brief period in beta, but was later rolled back after changes to privacy settings in iOS 14 rendered it too low impact to justify continued maintenance. However, my teammate and I won &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1800/PU/JP-7011011/3CE2815D9318E761AA5124BCD9A289ED1CEE4E6EE230751AC357FDA198F0AC47/15/en&quot;&gt;patent JP,2022-040842,A&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230196769A1/en?oq=2023/0196769&quot;&gt;US patent&lt;/a&gt; is still pending) for the design of the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/cookpad-patent-art.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Diagram from food photo filter patent&quot; title=&quot;Diagram from food photo filter patent&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Diagram from food photo filter patent&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I worked with a small group of R&amp;amp;D members on an RGB and thermographic camera system placed above one’s stovetop. As an R&amp;amp;D project, the scope of this project changed significantly over its lifetime. I wrote algorithms in Python for image registration, investigated HLS video streaming over AWS, and built myriad apps and tools in Swift and SwiftUI to move this data around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my projects during my time in R&amp;amp;D were short explorations. I researched, mostly from the applied technology side, topics like image segmentation, image classification, image inpainting, ML sound classification, pose detection, automatic video editing, and image generation with Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and Textual Inversion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, my persistent focus in R&amp;amp;D was the field of augmented reality. This started with building a “recipe playground” app built in Unity for the Microsoft HoloLens 2 and used in the kitchen. Later, I began building prototypes with Apple’s ARKit and RealityKit for iOS, with the knowledge that &lt;em&gt;eventually&lt;/em&gt; Apple would release a headset (Apple Vision Pro, announced at WWDC 2023).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although my primary role was R&amp;amp;D during this period, I split my time on a few other teams as well, working an average of 2-3 days a week on each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cookpad-japans-recipe-app&quot;&gt;Cookpad Japan’s recipe app&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a brief stint working part-time on Cookpad’s flagship &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%91%E3%83%83%E3%83%89-no-1%E6%96%99%E7%90%86%E3%83%AC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%94%E6%A4%9C%E7%B4%A2%E3%82%A2%E3%83%97%E3%83%AA/id340368403&quot;&gt;recipe app&lt;/a&gt; for the Japanese market as an iOS individual contributor. My biggest contribution was a recipe module presented when opening a recipe from an external source that included paging behavior between recommended recipes. The design spec was surprisingly complex and required significant planning work, experimentation, and eventually a custom UICollectionViewLayout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/cookpad-japan-recipe-carousel.gif&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Recipe carousel in the Cookpad Japan app&quot; title=&quot;Recipe carousel in the Cookpad Japan app&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Recipe carousel in the Cookpad Japan app&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tabedori&quot;&gt;Tabedori&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined the &lt;a href=&quot;https://note.com/tabedori/&quot;&gt;Tabedori&lt;/a&gt; team part-time for around 2 years. Tabedori was service within – but separate from – Cookpad run by a small team of between 4-8 members. I was originally slated to cover iOS duties for the 3 months of a coworker’s childcare leave, but the product and team resonated so well with me that I stayed until the product was discontinued in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service always served to teach people how to cook without recipes, but advanced through nearly 7 different versions over its lifetime, with myself contributing mostly as an iOS engineer for 2.5 versions. The first version I worked on was still primarily a UIKit codebase, but I added a chat system in SwiftUI, and then the final 2 versions of the app were all SwiftUI. It was the perfect environment for me to dive deep into the details of SwiftUI to understand its constantly evolving limitations from iOS 13 through 16 in real shipping app with a very opinionated style guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite eras was participating in 2 intense prototyping and exploration periods between versions 5 and 6, then versions 6 and 7. It was during this time we developed, iterated, pitched, and discarded dozens of prototypes individually and as a team, working towards a release. In a short period I learned so much about animations, gestures, navigation, and rapid UI development in SwiftUI, while also considering the product and design angles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/cookpad-tabedori-v7.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Tabedori version 7, developed with SwiftUI&quot; title=&quot;Tabedori version 7, developed with SwiftUI&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Tabedori version 7, developed with SwiftUI&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cookpad-global-redux&quot;&gt;Cookpad Global Redux&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to visit the Global headquarters in Bristol, UK for 2 months in late 2022. I had the chance to revisit a codebase I hadn’t touched in 3 years while working alongside new and old coworkers and cooking in the office kitchen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this point the Cookpad Global iOS codebase and development process had matured significantly. I dove back into UIKit and specifically UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and helped build an interface for exploring machine translated recipes from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cookpad-mart&quot;&gt;Cookpad Mart&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a company-wide restructuring in 2023, I found a new home in &lt;a href=&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%91%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%83%9E%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88-%E3%82%AF%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%91%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F/id1434632076&quot;&gt;Cookpad Mart&lt;/a&gt; for my final few months at Cookpad. I had been a long-time user of Cookpad Mart’s unique grocery delivery service since its early days and was looking forward to improving the service through the iOS app, its primary client-side interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an e-commerce startup, Cookpad Mart has the conflicting goals of being stable, robust, and bug-free enough to support reliable exchanges of goods for payment, while also needing to iterate quickly to find product market fit and profitability. I was incredibly humbled jumping in and seeing the evolution of a 5 year old codebase and how the alumni iOS engineers had handled these constraints. Much of the required reliability came from systems built &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the codebase, rather than the codebase itself: test plans in every pull request, thorough code reviews, a weekly release cadence automated to the bone, “tap parties” where all iOS team members get together to thoroughly test each new feature, rotating QA participation from the product and design departments, and finally a culture of bug fixes being high priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the Mart service itself underwent a massive pivot almost immediately after I joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-end-of-the-story&quot;&gt;The End of the Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cookpad as a company went through some significant turmoil starting in early 2023 with the departure of the Japan CEO, then a call for a round of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdf.irpocket.com/C2193/NJLt/hAIz/SDEh.pdf&quot;&gt;voluntary retirements (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in February, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdf.irpocket.com/C2193/CaoZ/acVo/MlYT.pdf&quot;&gt;CEO change (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; in May, and finally a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pdf.irpocket.com/C2193/CaoZ/qmSw/IQUI.pdf&quot;&gt;larger round (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; of voluntary retirements in June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was part of that last round of voluntary retirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My honest thoughts? It was good time for me to go. I’ve been immersed in solving problems in the food and cooking domain for these past 6 years. Although I’ve always considered cooking a genuine interest – especially in the context of moving to a different country – there are several other domains that I’d like to explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So cheers to a good ride. The part I’ll miss most is working with so many kind and talented coworkers, hopefully at least a few of which I’ll be able to work with again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Testing Reducers and Interactors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll discuss some techniques for testing the reducers and interactors we introduced in the previous &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/02/transitioning-between-view-states-using-reducers/&quot;&gt;reducers post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/11/05/interactors/&quot;&gt;interactors post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire test suite can be viewed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/ViewState&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt; for the example app. I’ll be excerpting a few illustrative cases in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the prescribed benefits of splitting our architecture into inert view models, single-state change reducers, long lived interactors, and a view layer is so that we could test each component individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaning on structs and enums as the input and output boundary of each component makes testing more straightforward; we need to create fewer mock classes to observe the behavior of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a special &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Scheduler&lt;/code&gt; type to control the flow of time allows us to test asynchronous behavior without slowing down testing. It also allows us to mimic any sort of delays or operation ordering that would usually cause subtle, difficult to reproduce bugs in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preview&quot;&gt;Preview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example app we had two systems: Profile and Posts. In this post we’ll only be showing examples from the Profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reducer is trivial to test. It’s a pure function with two inputs, one output, and no side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactor is a bit more complex. It will require a mock &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Service&lt;/code&gt; class for the data layer. It will require a special &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Scheduler&lt;/code&gt; type in order to control the flow of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-the-reducer&quot;&gt;Testing the reducer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the reducer, we’ll be testing each of the valid transitions specified by this diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-04.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These will be more akin to &lt;em&gt;unit tests&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outline-of-profileinteractorreducertests&quot;&gt;Outline of ProfileInteractorReducerTests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with an outline of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/code&gt; subclass we’ll be writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorReducerTests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testInitializedLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testLoadingLoaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testLoadingFailed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testFailedLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testLoadedLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mocks-and-helpers&quot;&gt;Mocks and helpers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we’ve namespaced our reducer under &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; we’ll make a type alias to cut down on some boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also make some mock structs to cut down on boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mock&lt;/code&gt; enum acts as a namespace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;avatarURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;https://en.gravatar.com/userimage/30721452/beb8f097031268cc19d5e6261603d419.jpeg&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twocentstudios&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Chicago&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
                           &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;twocentstudios.com&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’ll need to ensure we’ve implemented equatable for all of the structs we’ll use. This includes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor.Reducer.State&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor.Reducer.Command&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor.Reducer.Effect&lt;/code&gt;. Otherwise, we’d have no way to assert.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-the-reducer-tests&quot;&gt;Writing the reducer tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the boilerplate out of the way, let’s write our first test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first valid transition is a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Initialized&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt; state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that this state transition does not go directly from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Initialized&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loaded&lt;/code&gt; and hit the network or perform other side effects. The reducer is a synchronous function. Its two outputs are 1. the state of the view model updated to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt; and 2. the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.load&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; which will be used by the interactor to perform side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/02/transitioning-between-view-states-using-reducers/&quot;&gt;view state post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/02/transitioning-between-view-states-using-reducers/&quot;&gt;reducers post&lt;/a&gt; for more background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorReducerTests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testInitializedLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1a. Create an initial `ProfileViewModel` and state containing it.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initialViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1b. Specify the `Command` that will direct the state transition.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2. Specify the target (expected) `ProfileViewModel`, `Effect`, and `State` combining the two.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetEffect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 3. Call the function with (1) and (2) and store the result.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 4. Assert the result from (4) is what we expect from (3).&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTAssertEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about as straightforward as you can get with a test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create some inert input data&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create our expected output structs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Call the function with the input data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assert that our function output equals the output we expect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, we can copy paste this general structure and change the input and expected values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There are probably better ways to automate writing and testing the reducer since it’s just a state machine. I’m open to ideas!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s show one more test for the transition from state &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Failed&lt;/code&gt;. Remember that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; for this state transition comes as a result of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Service&lt;/code&gt; returning a value (presumably from the server), and all of that is handled by the interactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorReducerTests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testLoadingFailed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initialViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTAssertEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same sequence of statements is used, but we’re comparing different inputs and outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-transitions-to-test&quot;&gt;Which transitions to test?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;, I’m only testing valid transitions. However, we could also test that invalid transitions are handled in a deterministic way. The rigor of your test coverage is up to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the most rigorous implementation of a reducer, you could add an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; for invalid transitions. Upstream, in the interactor, you could use that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; to log an error to an external service. This would keep your reducer completely deterministic and side-effect free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testing-the-interactor&quot;&gt;Testing the interactor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the interactor, we’ll be testing end-to-end transitions. We could also mirror our reducer tests, but as you’ll see, it makes more sense to lean towards &lt;em&gt;integration tests&lt;/em&gt; here since we can now fully exercise the asynchronous nature of the interactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ll talk a little bit about integration testing with the interactor vs UI testing with UIKit and Xcode a bit later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;outline-of-profileinteractortests&quot;&gt;Outline of ProfileInteractorTests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going back to our state transition diagram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-04.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s outline &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorTests&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorTests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initialized&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testInitialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initialized -&amp;gt; Load -&amp;gt; Loaded&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testInitializedLoadSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initialized -&amp;gt; Load -&amp;gt; Failed    &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testInitializedLoadFailure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Failed -&amp;gt; Load -&amp;gt; Success&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testFailureThenSuccess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve decided on four cases:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initialized&lt;/strong&gt; - ensure our system starts in a known state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initialized -&amp;gt; Load -&amp;gt; Loaded&lt;/strong&gt; - expected success case.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initialized -&amp;gt; Load -&amp;gt; Failed&lt;/strong&gt; - failure case.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failed -&amp;gt; Load -&amp;gt; Success&lt;/strong&gt; - retry failure to success case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;mocks-and-helpers-1&quot;&gt;Mocks and helpers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the reducer tests above, we’ll use some &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;typealias&lt;/code&gt;es and mocks to cut down on boilerplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll also need to add two new mock classes that our interactor(s) have as dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;profileservice&quot;&gt;ProfileService&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Mock.ProfileService&lt;/code&gt; should conform to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;protocol&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;readProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mock should return a valid user or an error depending on what we want to test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest version of this mock can just mirror whatever &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; we set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;readProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I made some helpers so the test code looks a little cleaner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testschedulercontext&quot;&gt;TestSchedulerContext&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interface for the interactor accepts a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SchedulerContextType&lt;/code&gt;. This requires a more detailed explanation, but for now I’ll explain the basics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SchedulerContextType&lt;/code&gt; asks for three distinct schedulers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; to update state by running the synchronous reducer function.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;work&lt;/code&gt; to dispatch asynchronous work like network requests.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; to set the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/code&gt; variables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will allow us to manipulate the flow of time and observe/assert the state of the system at critical points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestSchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContextType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestScheduler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestScheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestScheduler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestScheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestScheduler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestScheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testWork&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testOutput&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;nextOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;advance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testOutput&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;advance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;testWork&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;advance&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve added two helper functions to formalize how the schedulers should be advanced: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;nextOutput&lt;/code&gt; which accepts input, computes a new state, and delivers output; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;doWork&lt;/code&gt; which simulates the service layer returning a new result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;testobserver&quot;&gt;TestObserver&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TestObserver&lt;/code&gt; is a helper class specifically for testing the output of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/code&gt; signals. This was originally written by the Kickstarter team (their source &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kickstarter/Kickstarter-ReactiveExtensions/blob/15631b40c437d18db4187d9b8ad117115775ea3f/ReactiveExtensions/test-helpers/TestObserver.swift&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The header comments explain its purpose:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;A `TestObserver` is a wrapper around an `Observer` that saves all events 
to an internal array so that assertions can be made on a signal&apos;s behavior. 
To use, just create an instance of `TestObserver` that matches the type of 
signal/producer you are testing, and observer/start your signal by feeding 
it the wrapped observer. For example,

 let test = TestObserver&amp;lt;Int, NoError&amp;gt;()
 mySignal.observer(test.observer)
 
 // ... later ...
 
 test.assertValues([1, 2, 3])
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;writing-the-interactor-tests&quot;&gt;Writing the interactor tests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the first test: ensuring our interactor has the expected initial state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorTests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Initialized&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testInitialState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;schedulerContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TestSchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Mocks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1. Create the interactor with dependencies.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;scheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;schedulerContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2. Create the expected view model.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 3. Probe the result view model stored in the property.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 4. Assert equality.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTAssertEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that we don’t need to run the output scheduler since the interactor’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModel.value&lt;/code&gt; is set on whatever scheduler &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; is called on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractorTests&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTestCase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 12. Assert that the view model is now in `loading` state.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;XCTAssertEqual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadedViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadedResult&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 13. Assert that there were no other side-effects produced.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;assertValueCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;assertDidNotComplete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple things to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[2][9][13] Because our &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interactor.effect&lt;/code&gt; is a stateless &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt;, we need to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TestObserver&lt;/code&gt; to temporary capture its values (or lack there of) to assert.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;[6][10] We have to call functions on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;schedulerContext&lt;/code&gt; to artificially advance time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interactor tests are more like integration tests. There’s a lot more internal behavior handled by the interactor in order to produce the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/code&gt; outputs. However, we get much more control and granularity as opposed to UI testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;the source&lt;/a&gt; for the other two cases I decided to test. They’re very similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ui-testing&quot;&gt;UI testing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judging from the types of testing I’ve decided to focus on in this post, you can probably glean some of my views on testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My past team experience focused on using manual pre-release testing to discover UI bugs. We did no automated UI testing at all. The biggest reason was that almost every screen in our app changed in a non-trivial way at least once a month. Maintaining expectation images and UI automation testing would have required resources we didn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, I specifically target my tests in code outside of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt;. The architecture itself from the last four posts is designed to push code as far as reasonably possible outside of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt; simply introduces far too much state and far too many side-effects into a system for me to feel confident that my tests are useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although there has been lots of progress made both by Apple and in open source in making UI testing more useful and feasible, I still consider manual testing to be more resource efficient than writing and maintaining a suite of UI tests especially for the kinds of apps I currently work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would love to have my mind changed though. I hope UI testing becomes more mainstream as tooling improves. And certainly if you have the design stability and the resources, automate as much testing as you can!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we looked at writing tests for our reducer and interactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reducer tests were trivial unit tests. The interactor tests are more involved, but give us a lot of control to test the limited interface of the interactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although on the surface scheduler contexts seem to complicate our code a bit, I think it’s really useful to have both control and understanding of how and when code is being run. Notice that we didn’t have to wait for any expectations. The test code follows a linear and logical progression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few questions I’d like to ponder for the future:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since our reducer is a straightforward state machine, are there better ways to automate testing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is there a way we can eliminate at least one of the three scheduler context types? Perhaps the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; scheduler can use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;output&lt;/code&gt; scheduler instead?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll finally be implementing the view layer of our example application that shows a user profile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the previous three blog posts, we’ve modeled the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2017/07/24/modeling-view-state/&quot;&gt;view state&lt;/a&gt;, then created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2017/08/02/transitioning-between-view-states-using-reducers/&quot;&gt;reducer&lt;/a&gt; to process changes to that view state, then created an &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2017/11/05/interactors/&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/a&gt; to process input events and manage the view state over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal in creating an interactor and a fully specified view state was to allow our view layer to be very dumb. There are a few reasons this is beneficial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Massive view controller is a well documented phenomenon. View controllers with many concerns quickly become large, unmanageable, and buggy as requirements change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The view layer has other concerns it can be smart about. There’s plenty of layout code, animations, styling, gesture handling, and UIKit ceremony that we don’t want cluttered with state manipulation code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UIKit is notoriously difficult to test. We can either choose to avoid brittle UI tests while still being confident in our view logic, or we can use XCUITest for high level integration testing and navigation testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that in this post, I’ll be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonyarnold/Differ&quot;&gt;Differ&lt;/a&gt; in my reference implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal will be a normal data load from two sources that looks like this video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-normal_load.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-normal_load-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we want to be able to seamlessly reload from failure like the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-failed.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-failed-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like in most MVVM variants, we’ll consider pretty much everything in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt; as part of the view layer. That means &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIApplication&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal for our view layer will be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Receive read-only view models from the interactor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure the view to match the view model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Send raw events (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;s) to the interactor in order to change the view state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the interface of the interactor we created in the last post for a hint as to how we’ll achieve the goals we listed above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Interactor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Outputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-receive-read-only-view-models-from-the-interactor&quot;&gt;1. Receive read-only view models from the interactor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&amp;lt;ViewModel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; provides us access to a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt; which will emit the latest &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt; on subscription and on every change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&amp;lt;ViewModel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; also provides us read-only access to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;, the latest &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt; that was sent through the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll need access to this because of the way the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; datasource and delegate APIs work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the interactor, we ensured that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/code&gt; is always set on the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-configure-the-view-to-match-the-view-model&quot;&gt;2. Configure the view to match the view model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt;. We therefore have to conform to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableViewDataSource&lt;/code&gt; and use its prescribed methods to assign view models to views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-send-raw-events-to-the-interactor-in-order-to-change-the-view-state&quot;&gt;3. Send raw events to the interactor in order to change the view state.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll wire up touch/selection events from the view layer to the interactor by mapping them to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; values and placing them on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/code&gt; bus using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.send(value: ...)&lt;/code&gt; syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve already done most of the heavy lifting in the interactor, reducer, and view model definition. We’ll mostly be doing the UI tasks of creating view subclasses, writing layout code, and implementing the required delegate methods for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find all the example code in the public &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/ViewState&quot;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. I won’t be covering any of the boilerplate view layout or configuration in this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;initialization&quot;&gt;Initialization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into the view controller now. We’ll assume our entire view controller/interactor/services system is configured in a coordinator or other layer above. That means &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewController&lt;/code&gt; depends only on a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;nibName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;configuration&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll be using a straightforward &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; with several cell types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember from the previous post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2017/07/24/modeling-view-state/&quot;&gt;modeling view state&lt;/a&gt; we cataloged our cell types pretty thoroughly already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profileHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileHeaderViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profileError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profileAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// &quot;Posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contentLoading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can simply look at our design mockup and create a cell for each of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/code&gt; cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each cell will have its own &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;configure(with: ViewModelType)&lt;/code&gt; method to apply the specific view data. For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UITableViewCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nameLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;valueLabel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then once we have all of our cell subclasses created, we’ll register them with the table view (using a handy &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;register&lt;/code&gt; extension on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;lazy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileHeaderCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ContentHeaderCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ContentLoadingCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ContentEmptyCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reloading-the-table-view---attempt-1&quot;&gt;Reloading the table view - attempt #1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with a naive implementation of table view reloading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;producer&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;skipRepeats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;startWithValues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unowned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reloadData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/code&gt; we’re setting up an observer that sends the latest view model. When a new view model is sent (and it’s not the same as the last one), we’ll reload the entire table view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although this works, it doesn’t look great. The cells snap in with no animation and it’s a little jarring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-reload_data.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-reload_data-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;assigning-data-to-cells&quot;&gt;Assigning data to cells&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we need to implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableViewDataSource&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already made a nice helper in the view model to get the number of rows:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;controlEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;touchUpInside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;take&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;until&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prepareForReuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observeValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unowned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;returnCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cellViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;dequeue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostCell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;indexPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cellViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;returnCell&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;returnCell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cellViewModelType&lt;/code&gt; from our view model helper which is of enum type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel.ViewModelType&lt;/code&gt;. That will tell us what kind of cell we need and what kind of associated data is paired with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we have a nice big &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; statement that the compiler will enumerate the required cases for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the cases have the same three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dequeue the correct type of cell (with a helper function).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure the cell with the associated data (the type will always match).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return the cell&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error cells are interactive and expose buttons. We’ll use some reactive magic to transform button taps to commands on the interactor:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;controlEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;touchUpInside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;take&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;until&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prepareForReuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observeValues&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unowned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.take&lt;/code&gt; will ensure that reused cells will dispose of their subscriptions and no longer send events. If we neglect this, each time the cell is reused, another subscription will be added and the interactor will end up receiving 2+ commands for every 1 button tap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll use the exposed &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/code&gt; to send &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor.Command.loadProfile&lt;/code&gt;. This is the behavior as if we called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interactor.loadProfile()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interactor.processCommand(.loadProfile)&lt;/code&gt;, but we’re not burdening the interactor with lifting messages into the reactive world (this is a judgement call and you can draw the line wherever feels most appropriate).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;reactive-aside-binding-to-sinks&quot;&gt;Reactive Aside: binding to sinks&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why leave the reactive world with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;observeValues&lt;/code&gt; just to re-enter by sending a value to a signal observer? It seems natural to write the following code instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;controlEvents&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;touchUpInside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;take&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;until&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reactive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prepareForReuse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadProfile&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish this worked (it’s a lot more elegant!). However, the signal we’re creating completes as expected when the cell is reused. Since we’ve wired the signal directly to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/code&gt; will also complete, leaving our interactor without the ability to receive any new commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;kicking-off-the-load&quot;&gt;Kicking off the load&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to kick off the initial data load request. I’ve decided to be pessimistic about data cache longevity and issue a new request on every &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewWillAppear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewWillAppear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewWillAppear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadPosts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadProfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw this same code in the error table view cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reloading-the-table-view---attempt-2&quot;&gt;Reloading the table view - attempt #2&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our view controller works! But that view reloading is still not great. Since we’ve already gone through the trouble of implementing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/code&gt; for all of our view models, let’s use a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tonyarnold/Differ&quot;&gt;diffing library&lt;/a&gt; to derive precision changes we can make to the table view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;producer&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;skipRepeats&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;scan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;unowned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;old&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;animateRowChanges&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;oldData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;old&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;newData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;deletionAnimation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;insertionAnimation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fade&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to write this signal chain. Our technique will be to use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.scan&lt;/code&gt; to get access to the previous and latest view models so that we can derive and apply a changeset with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Differ&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks a lot nicer now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The happy path loading successfully looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-normal_load.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-normal_load-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two separate parts of our view that can fail can be reloaded completely independently even though they’re in the same table view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-failed.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/view_controller_with_interactor-failed-poster.png&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we looked at the implementation for a view layer that can:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;use the (equatable) view model structures we created the previous posts to populate the final representation of the views.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;react intelligently to changes in the entire view model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post concludes this short series about using view models, reducers, interactors, and diffing to create a heterogeneous view layer.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Asynchronous Changes to View Models Using Interactors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a look at a technique to facilitate the changes to our view states in Swift, as well as how to incorporate asynchronous behavior into this system. I’ll refer to this system by the name &lt;em&gt;interactor&lt;/em&gt; throughout this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will be the longest post in the series. It builds on the previous posts about &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/24/modeling-view-state/&quot;&gt;view models&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/08/02/transitioning-between-view-states-using-reducers/&quot;&gt;reducers&lt;/a&gt; so please read those posts before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we’ll look at how we can use the interactor we’ve created in this post to drive our view layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, we’ve been working with stateless value types (view models) and a stateless function (reducer). Since our view layer is inherently stateful, we need a reference type to manage the current state (view model) and its changes over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last post about reducers, we mentioned finite state machines a few times. Our interactor will be the implementation of the finite state machine for our view state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note that in this post, I’ll be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/a&gt; in my reference implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to make a quick aside about how this architecture relates to prior art. The interactor, reducer, and view model I’ve discussed all belong to a middle layer between the view layer and the model layer, in many standard MVVM architectures called the view model layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the architecture I’m presenting, there is a difference in nomenclature between a stateless view model and a stateful view model, whereas in classic MVVM, this distinction isn’t made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going forward, an &lt;strong&gt;interactor&lt;/strong&gt; will be a reference type that holds representations of state over time (variables, signals, data sources). A &lt;em&gt;view model&lt;/em&gt; will be a value type that holds a representation of state at one moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goal&quot;&gt;Goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal for the interactor is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;accept events from the view layer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expose the current view state to the view layer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expose view state change events to the view layer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;expose side-effect events to the parent layer (coordinator).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;template&quot;&gt;Template&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be expressed in a template interface (we’ll fill this in more later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Interactor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Outputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2, 3&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The template above is common to all interactors. It covers all possible scenarios (and is quite testable too!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/interactors-public-interface.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at each goal in detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-accept-events-from-the-view-layer&quot;&gt;1. Accept events from the view layer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like we introduced &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Command&lt;/code&gt; in the last post, we’ll also have &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Command&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Command&lt;/code&gt; is an enum that lists &lt;em&gt;all the events from the view layer that can cause the view model to change&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why we need both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Command&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Command&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Command&lt;/code&gt; will include entries from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Command&lt;/code&gt; and additional entries from the results of internal asynchronous events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/code&gt; is a signal observer. It’s a write-only entry point into the reactive world. The way you would place events onto it from the view layer would be e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interactor.commandSink.send(value: Interactor.Command.loadPosts)&lt;/code&gt;. This is the reactive equivalent of calling something like &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interactor.loadPosts()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-expose-the-current-view-state-to-the-view-layer&quot;&gt;2. Expose the current view state to the view layer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interactors are tailored to working with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UICollectionView&lt;/code&gt; APIs which require access to the current state throughout their data source callbacks. Therefore our interactor must allow &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; access to the view model at any given time on the main thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using ReactiveSwift’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/code&gt; type gives us imperative access to its current value from the view layer e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let currentViewModel = interactor.viewModel.value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-expose-view-state-change-events-to-the-view-layer&quot;&gt;3. Expose view state change events to the view layer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sort of view state change events that the view layer requires will differ depending on the desired view implementation. In the simplest version, our view layer only needs change events it can use to trigger calls to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tableView.reloadData()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can get this behavior from ReactiveSwift’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/code&gt; type as well subscribing to its &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;producer&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;signal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// In view controller&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;producer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;startWithValues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;weak&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tableView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reloadData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-expose-side-effect-events-to-the-parent-layer-coordinator&quot;&gt;4. expose side-effect events to the parent layer (coordinator)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this architecture, the view layer is not responsible for navigation. Navigation-related side effects are determined by the interactor and exposed to its parent coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to how was saw &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Effect&lt;/code&gt; in the last post, we also have an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Effect&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Effect&lt;/code&gt; lists all the possible side effects that can occur as a result of events in the view layer and view state changes within the interactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coordinator can subscribe to these side effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// In coordinator&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;observeValues&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Interactor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// present a new view controller based on `effect`        &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementation&quot;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our example, there will be two interactors &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsInteractor&lt;/code&gt; nested within &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;View the full code for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/ViewState/blob/8b7b75654baa5fcd4c0a41857fc948380641b6fd/viewstate/View%20Model/ProfileInteractor.swift&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/ViewState/blob/8b7b75654baa5fcd4c0a41857fc948380641b6fd/viewstate/View%20Model/PostsInteractor.swift&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsInteractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/ViewState/blob/8b7b75654baa5fcd4c0a41857fc948380641b6fd/viewstate/View%20Model/UserInteractor.swift&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the `&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/ViewState&quot;&gt;example project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;profileinteractor&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; by copying our template from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO: what external messages must we support?&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO: what effects will we produce?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;commandSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Outputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to determine what messages/data &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; can receive from the outside world and what effects it produces. Our current design of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; is read-only, so the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; are straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way the outside world can change &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt; is through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command.load&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; produces no side-effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that we also added &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSignal&lt;/code&gt; above as an internal implementation detail. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSignal&lt;/code&gt; is the read-only tap of the write-only &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; exposes to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; has 1 initializer and 3 functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;scheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO: set up the entire system.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This will be the most complex part of the class, but also&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// the most templated across all interactors.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO: convert a `Command` from the interactor&apos;s domain to&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// an `Command` in the reducer&apos;s domain.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This function has no side-effects.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO: convert an `Effect` from the reducer&apos;s domain to an&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `Effect` in the interactor&apos;s domain.&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This function has no side-effects.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toSignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO: produce a description of asynchronous work based on&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This function allows the reducer to be synchronous.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entire &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; of this class is set up in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; as a network of static &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;init&quot;&gt;Init&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; contains mostly boilerplate of creating signals and wiring them together with pure transformation functions. In this post I’ll explain which parts must be changed for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt;. In a subsequent post, I’ll explain how the system itself is designed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;scheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1 &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initialViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initialEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 3&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stateReducer&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;scheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;work&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toSignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 6&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;internalCommandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;initial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;then&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModelSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effectSignal&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our initializer signature may need different types of static input data and data services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;An interactor must always have a view model after it has finished initialization. It’s up to us to choose. It’s an easy choice because we already created an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/code&gt; state definition for our view model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; is part of our reducer state, we must also choose an initial effect emitted during initialization. It will almost always be nil.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor.toCommand&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor.toEffect&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Target &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor.toSignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;. You may need to provide different data or services in order to create the asynchronous jobs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; implementation is essentially the same across all interactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’ll fill in the implementations for the other 3 functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tocommand&quot;&gt;toCommand&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toCommand&lt;/code&gt; we only need to convert from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Command&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Command&lt;/code&gt;, and they’re already straightforwardly aligned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toCommand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;toeffect&quot;&gt;toEffect&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toEffect&lt;/code&gt; we’re converting from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Effect&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Effect&lt;/code&gt;. However, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor.Effect&lt;/code&gt; is an empty &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;: all effects from the reducer are handled internally by the interactor (in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toSignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;). In more complex implementations, you’ll see many types of effects here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tosignalproducer&quot;&gt;toSignalProducer&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;toSignalProducer&lt;/code&gt; we’re handling effects from the reducer. If the reducer’s message was &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;load&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/code&gt; to make an asynchronous request. The data we receive, either a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;User&lt;/code&gt; or an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/code&gt;, is returned from the signal as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.Command&lt;/code&gt; that will be fed back into the reducer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toSignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;flatMapError&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;postsinteractor&quot;&gt;PostsInteractor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsInteractor&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; so we’ll skip the detailed explanation. View the code &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;userinteractor&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt; is a second type of interactor. It will compose &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsInteractor&lt;/code&gt;, wiring them up and exposing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt; to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt; has some of the same elements of our interactor template, but does not require a dedicated reducer, and does not have any infrastructure for making asynchronous requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadProfile&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadPosts&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;commandSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the public interface to both child interactors &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsInteractor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt; needs the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;s of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its child interactors have no external effects, and therefore &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t need to define any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the interface looks the same as our other interactors, with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt; exposed as in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s walk through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserInteractor.init&lt;/code&gt; to see how it compares to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/code&gt;’s implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;profileService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileServiceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;postsService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostsServiceType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;scheduler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SchedulerContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 1        &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;commandSink&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;profileInteractor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profileService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postsInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserInteractor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toEffect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;skipNil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The initializer signature contains all objects required to create its child interactors.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create the child interactors!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Like always, we need to make sure our view model &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/code&gt; is initialized with a valid view model. We do so by manually combining the initial values of the child interactors’ view models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;combineLatest&lt;/code&gt; is our makeshift reducer. It always combines the latest values of our two child view models and creates a brand new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Map commands of the parent interactor type to commands of the child interactor types.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge effects from both child interactors into one stream.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we discussed the design of a generic &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Interactor&lt;/code&gt; component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of the interactor is to accept events from the view layer, expose the current state of and changes to the view model, and expose side-effects generated alongside view model changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communication into and out of all interactors is done through 3 dedicated channels: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; input, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; output, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Property&lt;/code&gt; output which includes state and change events. Communication through these channels is done through dedicated &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;s or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent posts, we’ll discuss:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Transitioning Between View States Using Reducers</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a look at a technique to model transitions between view states in Swift. We’ll also look at how to model the commands that will initiate view state transitions, and the effects that will be produced by view state transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/24/modeling-view-state/&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt; we looked at modeling the view states themselves. We’ll revisit some of that code and build upon it in this post, but I would encourage you to read that post before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent posts, we’ll look at how to use our view models from the previous post and reducers from this post to create a full state machine in what we’ll call an interactor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last post, we ended up with a user profile screen that encapsulated two separate pieces of information: the user’s profile data and the user’s posts. Each has its own associated view states including &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-06.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have some view states, and now we need a way to describe how we’re allowed to transition in between those view states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a technique we can use to formalize these view state transitions. We’ll call this technique a &lt;strong&gt;reducer&lt;/strong&gt;. A reducer will:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List all commands that can &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; the view model state (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List all effects that describe &lt;em&gt;side-effects&lt;/em&gt; of view model state transitions (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine all valid transitions between view model states (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is lots of prior art on reducers, mostly from the functional programming world (I’ve included several links at the end of this post). In the context of finite state machines they’re called &lt;em&gt;transducers&lt;/em&gt;. We’re going to use &lt;em&gt;reducer&lt;/em&gt; in this post because of the rising popularity of Redux, Elm, ReSwift, etc. The name itself is just a name, and we’ll focus as much as possible on the attributes and the responsibilities of reducers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many architectures, transitioning between view states is done on an adhoc basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Often the previous view state is not consulted before transitioning to a view state, the result of which can be invalid view states, confusing transitions, or unwanted side-effects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sometimes it’s not even possible to determine a cohesive representation of the view state because it must be derived from the property values of several unrelated &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt; controls (e.g. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UISwitch.isOn&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UILabel.text&lt;/code&gt;, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The code for making view state transitions is scattered throughout a view controller and mixed in with unrelated static view configuration code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updating the model (and any additional overhead) must be done on the main thread, or a complex system of locking must be mixed in with the view code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no way to unit test the logic (or lack thereof) that controls view state transitions, especially because it is mixed in with asynchronous operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to define a strict interface for a system that will describe valid view state transitions. The inputs and outputs to the system will be value-types and therefore the whole system will be easily testable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is not necessarily complex. You’ll see in the implementation below that our reducer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is one static function.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Works only with value types.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is synchronous.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is stateless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;definitions&quot;&gt;Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into code, let’s run through some new terms that will help us distinguish how data will flow through the reducer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;view-model&quot;&gt;View model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We went into detail about view models &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/07/24/modeling-view-state/&quot;&gt;in the last post&lt;/a&gt;. The view model is a value type that transforms a view state into some output data that is easily consumable by an object in the view layer. A view model represents a view’s state at one moment in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;command&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; lists the valid events that can cause transitions between view states. Alongside the view model and effect, it is one of the inputs of the reducer function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;effect&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; lists the valid side-effects that occur alongside a view state transition. It is primarily used as an output of the reducer, but due mostly to implementation details, it is also provided as an input to the reducer. There may be some rare situation where knowing the last effect would be useful in making a view state transition, but usually it will be ignored as an input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;state&quot;&gt;State&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; combines a view model and an optional effect. One input and the output of the reducer are of type State. Note that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reducer.State&lt;/code&gt; is a different concept than &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reducer&quot;&gt;Reducer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general definition of a reducer is a function that takes a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; and produces a new &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-01.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our reducer’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; combines both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt;. So it’s better for us to look at the reducer’s inputs and outputs more like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-02.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll come back to these diagrams in a moment when we get to the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;general-implementation&quot;&gt;General Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another goal of this technique is that it can be used as a template throughout an app. The contents of each view model, effect, and command will be different, but the structure will be the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// cases:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// what events can cause this view model to change? &lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// cases: &lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// what side-effects occur alongside state changes?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Determine a new output State based on each input State &amp;amp; Command combination.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit here is that the process of writing new reducers is formalized around designing a well-specified state machine. Once you’ve designed the system, writing the code becomes the easy part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModelReducer&lt;/code&gt; struct acts as a namespace. It has no properties or initializers. (It might be more syntactically correct for it to be an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/code&gt; instead with no cases, but for now we’ll keep it as a struct).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;profile-implementation&quot;&gt;Profile Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt;: the top half of the user view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-06.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view model we created last time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the moment, we’re only concerned with the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; part as it’s the input to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/code&gt; property is the output used by the view layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we’ll copy/paste the template struct from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Skeleton implementation&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModelReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s map out the state from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-03.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our entry point is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Initialized&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Initialized&lt;/code&gt; can only go to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt; can transition to either &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loaded&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Failed&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loaded&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Failed&lt;/code&gt; may transition back through &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, let’s name the commands that will trigger these transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-04.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Load&lt;/code&gt; command can be issued from three states.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loaded&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Failed&lt;/code&gt; commands are only valid when the current state is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Loading&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go ahead and add these commands to our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Added `Command`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModelReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effect is next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we receive &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command.load&lt;/code&gt;, we want to both change the view state to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.loading&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; kick off an asynchronous network request to load the data. Our reducer is synchronous though, so we’ll use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; mechanism to specify exactly what asynchronous operation should be carried out on the reducer’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, it’s enough to simply define &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect.load&lt;/code&gt; with no enum case associated values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s are no other asynchronous requests we need to make in order to make all the other possible transitions, so the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; enum will only have one case this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a diagram of one state transition from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.initialized&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.loading&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/transitioning_view_states-05.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And our updated reducer code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Added `Effect`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModelReducer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; 
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;  
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// TODO&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re finally ready to implement the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt; function we’ll see that Swift’s enums really shine. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;ing over &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; allows the compiler to help us out and ensure we’ve covered all possible combinations (however, if you’re in a rush, you can always specify the known states and use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; case to cover the rest).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; through the cases as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt; or the reverse &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;. At the moment I prefer the former (and have written it below as such), but the latter may be easier to read after some time away from the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Unpack the arguments (we intentionally don&apos;t use `Effect` as an input).&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModelState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Create a convenience output `State` for invalid transitions.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;noChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Switch over `command` then `viewModelState`.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModelState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;noChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ignore `.load` command if we&apos;re already in a loading state.&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;noChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `.loaded` command can not be handled from any other view state besides `.loading`.&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;effect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;noChange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// `.failed` command can not be handled from any other view state besides `.loading`.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above implementation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We covered all combinations of the 3 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;s and 4 &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt;s.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invalid transitions are handled by not changing the view model and performing no side-effects (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;noChange&lt;/code&gt;). You may also consider adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;assertionFailure&lt;/code&gt;s to catch these attempted transitions during development if you believe they should never happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModelReducer&lt;/code&gt; is fully implemented and can be used in a dedicated interactor which will complete the state machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above combination of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;s and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel.State&lt;/code&gt;s is quite common and covers a lot of cases in every day iOS development. However, you’ll find plenty of subtle differences when implementing different screens. I’d like to cover some more complicated cases in an advanced post in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-use-effect&quot;&gt;Why use Effect?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may be wondering why we need &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt; at all. Why not just derive side-effects directly from the view model’s state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s sometimes possible to use view model directly, but in my experience mixing &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence#Computer_science_meaning&quot;&gt;idempotent&lt;/a&gt; state changes with non-idempotent side-effects ends up being more complex than treating them separately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the example above, let’s say we decide to kick off a network operation if the view model state becomes &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt; (this operation happens outside of the reducer). If a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command.load&lt;/code&gt; is processed by the reducer once, then again, the output state will become &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt; then remain &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt;. With our simple logic, we will kick off two network requests. Is that what we want in all cases? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to solve this problem, we would have to introduce more state checking in the code that kicks off the network operation. We’re now comparing the old state to the new state, but we’re already doing that inside the reducer! We’re now spreading business logic outside the reducer when our goal was the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reducer is the best place to determine the next state &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; any side-effects that occur based on state changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;separating-request-and-response&quot;&gt;Separating Request and Response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may be a little difficult to understand how the asynchronous network request fits into this reducer, especially after seeing that the reducer itself is synchronous. The short answer is that we’ll see in the next post about interactors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to give a brief preview, the way we’ll handle asynchronous operations is by separating the request from its response. In the eyes of the reducer, the network request is just another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt;. In the eyes of the reducer, the response to that network request is just another &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; that will potentially change the view state &lt;em&gt;depending on when that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt; is received&lt;/em&gt;. Anything could have happened to the view state while the asynchronous request was being made. Any situation like this will be handled in the same way: as just another input at some point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a simple view model like our example, it may seem like overkill to split the request and response. But think about a recent occasion when you’ve had to change some state based on multiple asynchronous requests triggered from multiple places in your view controller. How easy was it to make these changes in a performant and thread-safe manner? How sure were you that you had handled all the edge cases? How easy was it to test? How easy would it be to change this code based on new requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pros-and-cons-of-reducers&quot;&gt;Pros and Cons of Reducers&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing&lt;/strong&gt; - Using value types as input/output messages to a stateless static function makes this logic trivial to test. It’s so trivial you’ll think you’ve done something wrong. You can write a test for each valid transition in complete isolation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modifying code&lt;/strong&gt; - Adding new inputs or new view states is difficult, but in a good way. The Swift compiler will guide you through the process by ensuring you’ve still handled all possible combinations of commands and view states. Your tests will ensure you haven’t broken any existing transitions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reading code&lt;/strong&gt; - Your view state transition code is easy to find: it’s in the reducer. It’s keyed by command and view state. You don’t have to hunt through a 1000 line view controller to determine which of several possible functions could be changing your view state.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modeling state, transitions, and effects&lt;/strong&gt; - Modeling each of these concerns separately allows us to give each the proper consideration and do so in isolation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Templated problem solving&lt;/strong&gt; - I really love having a template I can follow to solve problems step by step. I can only fit so much in my head at once. Starting from modeling all states of a view then moving on to all the ways that view state can be changed allows me to focus on one problem at a time and be confident that there are no edge cases I haven’t handled. The Swift compiler always has my back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to our last post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More code&lt;/strong&gt; - There is lots more code to maintain. To be clear though, all of the conditions handled by this new code are either implicitly handled or completely disregarded in most other architectures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One big switch&lt;/strong&gt; - Some programmers consider switch statements, especially long ones, to be a code smell. I’d like to hear more opinions about whether a switch statement in this context is frowned upon and why.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exponentially increasing transition cases&lt;/strong&gt; - As more commands and more view states are added, the number of possible transitions that must be handled by your reducer can start to become overwhelming. When you feel overwhelmed, it may be a sign that your view model can be split into two and nested in a parent view model.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difficult to understand&lt;/strong&gt; - I believe that with the right surrounding documentation (hopefully this blog post), this technique is conceptually simple, especially to programmers with some background in functional programming. However, I can imagine that dropping a developer into this code may be a confusing and frustrating endeavor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we discussed using reducers as a single location to describe view state transitions and any side-effects based on those transitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at a reusable skeleton implementation for a reducer and its four parts: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Command&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Effect&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;. We looked at the reducer function itself and the way we can use &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt; to handle all transitions (both valid and invalid) of the state machine.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modeling View State</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’ll take a look at techniques to model view state in Swift. The goal of this post is to show how we’d go about translating a mockup like the one we’d receive from a designer and convert it into a set of inert view models that fully describe all possible states of our view, but without referencing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In subsequent posts, we’ll look at techniques to transition from one view state to another, ways to create an interactor to orchestrate this process over time, and finally how to consume this view model in a view controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;background&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many common architectures, the only way to determine the current state of a view is to query individual properties of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt; subclasses or visually inspect the final rendering of a view snapshot. Transitions between view states are handled on an ad-hoc basis or the previous view state is simply ignored. Testing is either ignored or implemented with complicated UI-based tooling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our goal with this technique is to have a full representation of all view states as a simple data structure in a separate conceptual layer from our UI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pros of this technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easier to manage secondary view states like loading, error, and empty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing is less complicated, and tests run faster.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Modularization: it’s easier to compose interactors and view models.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fewer bugs related to bad view state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cons of this technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Significantly more code.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All edge cases must be handled explicitly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More upfront planning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;More code must be changed if the design changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to illustrate this technique, we’ll be working through the user profile screen of a fictional social media app I just threw together. Any mockups you receive will probably look a lot nicer than this one 😉.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-0&quot;&gt;Version 0&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week’s sprint, we’ve been asked to implement a simple user profile screen. It won’t have all the bells and whistles yet. Our product manager has decided to push those to version 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our designer has sent us an initial mockup:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-01.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without much thought we get started with our implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say our models were previously specified by the backend engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;avatarURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the mockup, our view model is pretty straightforward. Just a little transformation for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;website&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// V0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;avatarURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSAttributedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that these properties are all optional. This decision is somewhat of a judgement call, but since the properties we’ll be setting on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt; views are optional, it makes sense that we may want to distinguish between a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;none&lt;/code&gt; value and an empty value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The V0 view model above is generally where most of us would start coding up view controllers. However, we’d soon realize that we’re missing a few view states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-1&quot;&gt;Version 1&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve realized that user profile data is loaded asynchronously from the server, so we request a loading state mockup as well. Our designer obliges:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-02.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this simple case, our designer thinks it’s fine to block the whole screen until the data has been loaded. We could probably optimize this, but we’ll let it go for version 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also inform our designer that our customers may encounter network errors and we should give them the option to retry loading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-03.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our designer provided a fine looking error state for the profile, but there’s one more state we need. Our profile screen actually has a state before we’ve started our initial load.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-04.png&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And with that last screen, we’ve covered all the cases we need for V1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-05.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now start modeling the rest of our view state, confident that our users will have a better experience if they have a slow or spotty data connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The responsibility of our view model is to transform model data into a representation that is immediately consumable by objects in the view layer with very little further transformation. In practice, this is more art than science so-to-speak. There are many correct solutions. View model design can still be heavily reliant on the specifics of how we decide to implement the view layer, e.g. using a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; versus using normal &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIView&lt;/code&gt;s and a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIScrollView&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the current mockup, I’m going to implement the view layer without a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; since the identity and location of views is known at compile time. To implement the loading and error states, I’ll add a full screen error view and loading view to the view hierarchy and toggle their hidden states.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The output properties for our view model will now be the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// V1 - only outputs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;avatarURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSAttributedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;actionTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;loadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;errorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re going to have three distinct subviews (user, loading, and error), we’ll create a separate view model for each. We’ve also added a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/code&gt; property to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt; for the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/code&gt; state before &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt; begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On every view state change, we can set all the properties on all our views. The view layer won’t need to ensure its states are consistent. That responsibility resides in the view model and can be tested independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve determined the outputs that our views need, let’s go back and figure out the inputs and internal state we need to determine those outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// V1 - inputs and outputs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;avatarURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSAttributedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;website&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;actionTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;userViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;errorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;errorViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;errorViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;userViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isHidden&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;errorViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three inner view models (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoadingViewModel&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/code&gt;) are initialized with an optional model object (I’ve elided their implementations).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary view model (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt;) is initialized with an enum &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;, with each case representing one state from our designer’s mockup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within the initializer, we map each state to a fully configured set of outputs. A different object will be responsible for initializing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt; and determining valid state changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that, we now have a fully specified view model. We’ll also have a very light view controller since all we have to do is assign all relevant properties directly whenever the view state changes. (As previously mentioned, we’ll discuss the rest of the implementation of this system in subsequent posts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;version-2&quot;&gt;Version 2&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Version 1 has been released into the wild and now our product manager wants to add the user’s posts to their profile screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some planning with design and our backend team, it’s been decided that user profile data and user post data will come from separate API endpoints. Since we’re a relatively new service, we won’t worry about paging yet (I’d like to cover paging in a future blog post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our product manager and designer have also determined that they’d like a prettier loading state for the user attributes. (Our designer has also preemptively mocked up all the required states for us).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/modeling_view_state-06.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s enumerate the changes we’ll have to make to the view models:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since our view now includes an indeterminate amount of posts, we’ll convert our view layer to use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITableView&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UICollectionView&lt;/code&gt; instead of a static view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;That means we should split up our header view into multiple cells.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ll need to make a new shimmering &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UILabel&lt;/code&gt; class for displaying &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/code&gt; states.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We have two independent view states (profile and posts). We should model these separately and compose them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start by creating the smallest building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// V2 - building blocks&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;actionTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingTextViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSAttributedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;
          
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;isLoading&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bool&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSAttributedString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileHeaderViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;avatarURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingTextViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;friendsCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;LoadingTextViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the above will map 1-to-1 with a cell, except for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;LoadingTextViewModel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compose the above view models into the view models for profile and posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// V2 - component view models&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;header&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileHeaderViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;attribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;initialized&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;loaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;failed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;loading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;empty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/code&gt; are responsible for transforming their input &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; into a list of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/code&gt; corresponding 1-to-1 with cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally we can compose these two view models into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// V2 - screen-level view model&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profileHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileHeaderViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profileError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profileAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileAttributeViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// &quot;Posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;contentLoading&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentEmpty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ErrorViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;post&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Inputs&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;profileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;postsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Output&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;profileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;postsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profileViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postsViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;profileViewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;postsHeaderViewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;contentHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Posts&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;postsViewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;toViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;innerViewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profileViewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postsHeaderViewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;postsViewModels&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;innerViewModels&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;toViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewModelType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;cm&quot;&gt;/* ... */&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt; only needs to map the inner view model types to its own enum &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel.ViewModelType&lt;/code&gt; and concatenate the results into one array. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UserViewModel&lt;/code&gt; has no state of its own. It composes the contents of its view models and exposes its own set of view models to the view layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The view layer will only need to access &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We now have the option of using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ProfileViewModel&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/code&gt; alone on other screens, or composing them with other view models into other combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling view model state is only a small part of designing a robust screen. I’ve elided a lot of the implementation details in this post in order to keep it more concise. I’ll explore the integration of these view models into the rest of the system in subsequent posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I’ve also elided &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/code&gt; implementations for each of these structs. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/code&gt; conformance is important in doing diffing on the view side since our entire screens view model will change on every update to the composed view models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should now be easier to understand the pros this technique:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The view controller is now mostly glue code, setting view models on subviews.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Comparing view states when testing (with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/code&gt; implemented) is as simple as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;XCTAssertEqual(viewModel, expectedViewModel)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;PostsViewModel&lt;/code&gt;’s logic can be used on other screens. There’s even some breathing room for using different view designs with the same data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using explicit enumerable input states for our higher-level view models ensures that no bad view states can occur.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once view states are explicitly defined, it’s trivial to pass off the work of creating a view layer to another engineer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the cons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lots more code to write and maintain, especially when considering manually writing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Some background knowledge about how to implement the view hierarchy in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/code&gt; needs to be known ahead of time in order to correctly design the view models on the first try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider the overhead to be worthwhile if your objective is robust code, the design is relatively stable, and testing is part of your culture. Conversely, it might not be worthwhile if your product design is undergoing rapid change, secondary view states are not important to product validation, and a certain quantity of bugs are acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Stateless Coordinators</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post, I’m presenting an experimental iOS architecture I’m calling &lt;strong&gt;Stateless Coordinators&lt;/strong&gt;. Consider what I’ll present as still a work in progress. Along the way I’ll be posing questions and considerations for changes or improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Update: Soroush suggested “View Controller Factories” would be a more fitting name for this pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: all code in this post targets Swift 3.0.1 and ReactiveSwift 1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this architecture is to abstract out the presentation and flow responsibility of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; and its subclasses in order to make the view layer of the application more composable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed architecture is an alternate take on the Coordinator Pattern. I found inspiration in the following posts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/&quot;&gt;Coodinators Redux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://irace.me/navigation-coordinators&quot;&gt;Navigation Coordinators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/a-pragmatic-functional-reactive-architecture-with-swift-1e564cdbb1a4&quot;&gt;A Pragmatic Functional Reactive Architecture in Swift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://merowing.info/2016/01/improve-your-ios-architecture-with-flowcontrollers/&quot;&gt;Improve your iOS Architecture with FlowControllers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tools we’ll use are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reactive programming; specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Swift enums&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stateless coordinator modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll specifically be avoiding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The delegate pattern&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stateful coordinator objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons for using and not-using these tools will be discussed along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If you aren’t familiar with ReactiveSwift, some of the code I’ll present will look like magic, but hopefully will still be comprehensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;responsibilities&quot;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I’m only going to discuss two major components to the architecture: the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; family and coordinators. In the future I’d like to expand more on other ways to extract responsibilities from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; (specifically view models), but for the purposes of this post, let’s assume that the view controller is responsible in one way or another for everything besides managing the presentation flow of itself or its children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into code, let’s enumerate the responsibilities of coordinators and view controllers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coordinator will be responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declaring a specific set of inputs and outputs that it knows how to handle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accepting dependencies required by the view controller.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a view controller of a specific identity and providing it its dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating a signal flow between view controller outputs and inputs with any required transformations in between.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Application flow side effects: presenting, dismissing, pushing, or popping child view controllers, but not itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Data modification side effects: performing any other side effects that don’t belong to a specific view (this one is a little hazy at the moment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A view controller will be responsible for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declaring a specific set of inputs and outputs that it knows how to handle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing a view hierarchy and keeping it updated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fetching data.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Handling user touch input.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-it-work&quot;&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the trademarks of a reactive architecture is “setting up the world” so to speak when initializing a system. Essentially wiring together inputs and outputs so that dynamic events and behavior is routed at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have two seemingly conflicting goals:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leverage standard UIKit view controller lifecycle and presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the presentation responsibility from view controller subclasses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our strategy will be to create a standardized public extension point on each view controller in which we can add behavior at view controller creation time. The extension point will be a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt; and we’ll add behaviors by attaching observers. By tying the lifetime of these behaviors to their view controller, we can avoid the common difficulties of working against UIKit patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That strategy probably doesn’t make sense yet. It’s okay because we’re going to go through lots of code examples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;code-examples&quot;&gt;Code examples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A goal of this architecture it to provide a template for modules of our system that is both predictable and flexible. Simple modules should not be overloaded with boilerplate and complex modules should not be unimplementable and degrade into spaghetti.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to illustrate some examples from simple to complex, introducing one or two unique aspects of this architecture at a time. We’ll start with four view controller examples then move on to coordinators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;view-controller&quot;&gt;View controller&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-template&quot;&gt;Basic template&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of our view controllers will have the shape of the code below. We’ll add more as the complexity of this module increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIKit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to note is each view controller specifically declares what dynamic inputs it accepts and what dynamic outputs it provides to the outside world. The template view controller above is completely static with no input or output cases. Because these enums are nested within the view controller, they can always be named &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we have a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/code&gt; pair for inputs and one for outputs. The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;private&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;internal&lt;/code&gt; distinctions are intentional: the outside world can send inputs (of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt;) on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/code&gt; and can observe outputs (of type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt;) on &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the type signature (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/code&gt;), these signals can’t error. They are also not intended to complete before the view controller has deallocated, but we’ll have to take some additional steps to guarantee that behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;one-button-one-output&quot;&gt;One button, one output&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s say we have a view controller with one static button that says “start”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-01.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;StartViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tappedStart&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;nibName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;viewDidLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIButton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;roundedRect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setTitle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Start&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;addTarget&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;selector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;doStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;touchUpInside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;addSubview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;button&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;doStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tappedStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few small changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve added a new output case &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tappedStart&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’ve added a button with a standard target/selector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We’re sending &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs.tappedStart&lt;/code&gt; to the private &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/code&gt; on each button tap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outside world can subscribe to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; on this view controller and respond to the single event type &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tappedStart&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For now, I’m going to continue using the grammar &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tap&lt;/code&gt; for view controller outputs (sending them “as is” so to speak) and allowing subscribers translate the meaning. In the future, I’ll probably revisit this decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try something more useful. Now the view controller will accept a static list of pizza toppings, and broadcast the ones the user chose or allow the user to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-02.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;typealias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PizzaTopping&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SelectToppingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UITableViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tapCancel&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve added a table view with multiple selection as well as two bar button items. Since our input is static (i.e. the input will not change for the entire lifetime of the view controller), we don’t have to declare it as a part of our signal &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice we’re sending an associated value &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[PizzaToppings]&lt;/code&gt;. Another important note is that view controllers should only communicate to the outside world through immutable data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The public API surface of this subclass is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;init(toppings: [PizzaTopping])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal: Signal&amp;lt;Outputs, NoError&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cells-with-multiple-buttons&quot;&gt;Cells with multiple buttons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see how this pattern extends deeper into the view hierarchy by introducing reusable cells with inner buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;This example isn’t strictly necessary to understand the coordinator section, so feel free to skip it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time we have a view controller that shows a static table of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; tweets, each with a share button and a save button. The outputs available to external classes are &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tapSave(Tweet)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tapShare(Tweet)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-03.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Note: I’ve included only the code necessary to illustrate this technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TweetViewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapShare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModel&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewModels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;indexPath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;row&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cell&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TweetViewModel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TweetsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapSave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapSave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapShare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapShare&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to use a dedicated view model for each tweet. It’s possible to use this technique without a view model, but the reuse semantics are a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TweetViewModel&lt;/code&gt; has a output signal/observer set. When a view model is assigned to a visible cell, a button tap on that cell will be transformed into a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tapShare&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tapSave&lt;/code&gt; enum value on the view model’s output signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to capture those values, we created another signal/observer pair called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputBusSignal&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputBusObserver&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputBusSignal&lt;/code&gt; is a signal of signals whose values are merged into our standard &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering, why do we need a bus? Instead of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputBusObserver.send(value: vm.outputSignal.map(mapIO))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can’t we just do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModel.outputSignal.map(mapIO).observe(outputObserver)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason is safety. As the consumer of the view model, we can’t guarantee that &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;viewModel.outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; won’t send a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.completed&lt;/code&gt; ReactiveSwift event. If it does, the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.completed&lt;/code&gt; event will propagate through and terminate all the downstream signals and no further events can be processed by the system. (This problem could be solved by a specialized reactive framework signal that 1. only sends values and 2. stays alive only as long as it is retained by its owner.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore another cardinal rule of this architecture while using a value/error/completed reactive framework is &lt;strong&gt;never connect signals directly together&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving on. You’ll also notice the static function &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/code&gt; that transforms the child’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt; type to the parent’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static func mapIO(output: TweetViewModel.Outputs) -&amp;gt; TweetsViewController.Outputs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this architecture, you’ll see this function defined on its own very often for the sake of explicitness. In general, this architecture focuses on wiring input and output signals together in various ways, transforming the inner values. I’ve standardized the name as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/code&gt;. Conveniently, in case your class has to map different output types you can use the same function name. You’ll see more examples in the upcoming coordinators section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;additional-complexity&quot;&gt;Additional complexity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I haven’t illustrated more complex cases like using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; signal of the view controller. At the moment, I have an vague idea of how I’d want to use the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; signal instead of passing in data providers or view models to the view controller. For now though, I’d like to move on to the coordinators to see how we can actually use the standardized &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt; signal of multiple view controllers to manage our view controller hierarchy from above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, through these examples you’re getting a feel for what we’re trying to accomplish. We’ve created a strict grammar for communication with view layer classes in our architecture (analogous to a protocol) and provided an extension point for coordinators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;coordinator&quot;&gt;Coordinator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll first outline the general shape of a coordinator in this architecture. Then I’ll show implementations of three common view controller paradigms in iOS: modal presentation/dismissing, navigation pushing/popping, and selection by tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;basic-template-1&quot;&gt;Basic template&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Coordinator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coordinators in this architecture are structurally quite simple. A coordinator is a container for static functions, the most important being the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt; is a static function, it needs to take in any dependencies required to initialize its view controller. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt; will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; return a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; subclass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Aside: why not make &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Coordinator&lt;/code&gt; a protocol? &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt;’s arguments vary on the type of view controller being created. The type of view controller being returned needs to be knowable by the calling class so that its input and output signals can be properly utilized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because coordinators are simply recipes for creating view controllers and wiring together signals, we don’t need to worry about creating a whole sidecar system that simultaneously owns and takes orders from UIKit. (A lot of the motivation behind this architecture was getting tired of fighting UIKit, but still wanting to improve MVC). View controllers still follow their lifetime semantics when they’re attached to windows and presented by other view controllers. There’s no double referencing or external monitoring of UIKit’s inner workings required. This also means we could add this architecture to an existing architecture simply by vending a new view controller from a coordinator into the existing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How we go about working within the UIKit system will be illustrated in the examples to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presenting&quot;&gt;Presenting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most simple case is a view controller that wants to present an error. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIAlertController&lt;/code&gt; handles its own dismissal so at this point we won’t worry about handling output from a presented view controller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-04.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: I’ve omitted some code in the sample below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NSError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;alertController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;AlertCoordinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;present&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;alertController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;completion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;nil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AlertCoordinator&lt;/code&gt; is as simple as the template. It configures a view controller (in this case, pretty trivially) and returns it. Whether this work can be inlined into the caller depends on how complex the set up is, how often these kinds of view controllers will be created, and your discretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/code&gt;, in addition to creating a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/code&gt;, we’re attaching an ad-hoc observer to its &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll ensure the observe block is executed on the UI thread because we can’t guarantee &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; will always return values on the UI thread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have to create a unowned capture block for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/code&gt;, otherwise it will create a retain cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We switch on all output types. In this case there’s only one. Personally, I like exhaustive enums and if a view controller added an output type, I would want to ensure it was handled in the coordinator or intentionally discarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caller of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/code&gt; (and receiver of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/code&gt;) could be the our app delegate or a completely separate module of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/code&gt; is returned directly from the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt; function, that also means the caller has the ability to attach any number of observers to the public &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainViewController.outputSignal&lt;/code&gt;. This functionality may be useful, but you’ll see in the coming examples that navigating in this fashion is relatively rare in data driven apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lifetime of the observe block we created is tied directly to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainViewController.outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; which will be destroyed alongside &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/code&gt; itself is stateless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;navigation-stack&quot;&gt;Navigation stack&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that in data driven apps, view controllers are almost always in a navigation stack, and similarly are presenting other navigation stacks. Therefore, I created a helper &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt; subclass for use in coordinators. Let’s take a look at the template for what I call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;InputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;OutputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;InputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Observer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;InputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputBusSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputBusObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;OutputType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputBusSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputBusSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;flatten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;merge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;nibName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nibNameOrNil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nibBundleOrNil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt; will be more clear in the coming examples. For now, notice that the input/output signal structure looks similar to our view controllers, except the input and output types are specified by the instantiating coordinator and the basic signal pairs are public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;presenting-and-dismissing&quot;&gt;Presenting and dismissing&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s imagine we have an app with a main view controller and a settings view controller, each within a navigation stack. The main view controller presents a settings view controller modally. The settings view controller can be dismissed, but no model data is transferred between the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-05.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll split the code up this time, showing the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SettingsCoordinator&lt;/code&gt; components on their own first. (Note: I’ve omitted some code for clarity.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SettingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tapDone&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SettingsCoordinator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;settingsViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SettingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rootViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputBusObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;settingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SettingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SettingsCoordinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tapDone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt; is essentially a wrapper for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SettingsViewController&lt;/code&gt; in this case. This architecture makes it pretty straightforward to forward signals alongside a quick map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned in the view controllers section, we’re placing &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;settingsViewController&lt;/code&gt;’s mapped &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; on an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputBusObserver&lt;/code&gt; instead of connecting it directly to maintain safety. We shouldn’t assume &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;settingsViewController.outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; will never complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Unsafe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;settingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;observe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Safe&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputBusObserver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;settingsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now callers of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SettingsCoordinator&lt;/code&gt; can interact with the returned &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt; like they do with any other view controller by observing its outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I almost always follow the rule that view controllers should not dismiss themselves, even though UIKit is pretty lax with allowing this behavior (and allowing any view controller to walk the parent/child chain up and down). The reason being that the view controller shouldn’t be aware of its presentation context. That’s why this coordinator returns &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;done&lt;/code&gt; instead of just dismissing itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;At the moment, I haven’t figured out a way to obscure the concrete &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt; behind a protocol when it’s returned from a coordinator’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt; function. Therefore all its public signals and observers are available down the stack, even though they shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s look at the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/code&gt; which will be responsible for presenting and dismissing the result of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SettingsCoordinator&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tapSettings&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;presentSettings&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dismissChild&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;rootViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;navigationController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;tapSettings&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;presentSettings&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mapIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;SettingsCoordinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainCoordinator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;output&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dismissChild&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re going to use a new technique since this coordinator is a bit more complicated. We’re going to map all side-effecting actions to specific coordinator &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; and map and pipe all output signals from view controllers into &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputObserver&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll declare all the action/data pairs that this coordinator can process as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m not 100% sold on whether marking internal actions as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; is a sustainable idea. In theory they shouldn’t necessarily be exposed as &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt;. There should be another internal signal type that handles the primary data processing flows for the coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rootViewController&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mainViewController&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t need to be initialized within the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/code&gt; processing chain. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mainViewController.outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; will be mapped and connected to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputBusObserver&lt;/code&gt;. We’ve seen this pattern a few times already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving into the observe block, we’ll find two cases we need to cover. In general, the code within each case should only be about 3 lines long max like shown in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;presentSettings&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Vend a new view controller.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect outputs to inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Present the view controller.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For side effects with no output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt; and discard the output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For side effects with output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wire the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;’s resulting &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Signal&lt;/code&gt; to the navigation controller’s input bus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pushing-and-popping&quot;&gt;Pushing and popping&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate pushing and popping with a navigation controller, let’s look at an “infinite pushing” interface with a simplified version of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this version we have a root view controller that shows tweets on your timeline. From here, you can tap on any tweet or user to view to push the tweet detail view controller or user view controller, respectively. From the user view controller you can view any of that user’s tweets in a detail view. From the tweet detail view controller you can view the details of any other tweet in the replies, view any user profile listed in the replies, or perform a secret gesture to pop back to your timeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-06.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Note: some structural code has been omitted for clarity. Data fetching code has also been omitted.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TweetsViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapTweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Tweet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TweetDetailViewController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;tapUser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UIKit will handle the standard back behavior automatically for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tabbar-interface&quot;&gt;TabBar interface&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If none of the view controllers contained by the tab bar view controller pass data or otherwise need to interact, our tab bar coordinator is as straightforward as it usually is with UIKit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/stateless_coordinators-07.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;MainTabBarCoordinator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;viewControllers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timelineNavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;notificationsNavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profileNavigationController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tabBarController&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;setViewControllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;viewControllers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tabBarController&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the navigation controllers vended by the coordinators will handle its own stack transparently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the more complicated (and usual) case that our child view controllers have outputs, we should use a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UITabBarController&lt;/code&gt; subclass identical to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt; subclass &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt; shown previously in this post. The layout of the coordinator will look similar to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCoordinator&lt;/code&gt;s also presented previously. The primary differences will be that all the view controllers will be created up front (and not in response to another view controller’s output), and all view controller output signals can be wired up at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;code-example-wrap-up&quot;&gt;Code example wrap up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We looked at a fair amount of code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we looked at view controllers in the context of this architecture pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard pattern for view controllers is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare an enum of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare a public input observer and a public output signal to accept and transmit dynamic events during the view controller’s lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept static dependencies in the initializer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we looked at stateless coordinators in the context of this architecture pattern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The standard pattern for coordinators is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify as a struct with no state or static methods.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare an enum of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt; if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare a static function called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt; that returns a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIViewController&lt;/code&gt; subclass.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accept static dependencies necessary for creating child view controllers in the initializer for &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vend&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declare pure transformation functions between child view controller outputs and coordinator inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dynamically attach child view controller outputs to coordinator inputs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform navigation related side effects or other side effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left out a few relevant code examples for this post. One example I’d like to tackle in the future is using a navigation controller as a “builder” of intermediate steps. The navigation patterns presented above can’t carry state between intermediate steps without passing &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; information to each step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;unique-attributes&quot;&gt;Unique attributes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This architecture has few unique attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;inputoutput-enum-for-specifying-boundaries&quot;&gt;Input/Output enum for specifying boundaries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enums are one of my favorite features of Swift. I like the exactness of being able to specify “this data can only be one of the these &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; types” and knowing the compiler will tell me if I’ve forgotten any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that enums can be a sign of brittleness or tight coupling. However, in the context of this architecture, I consider enums to be a useful building block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;signals-as-the-facilitators-of-state&quot;&gt;Signals as the facilitators of state&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of posts about the positives of reactive programming. I’ll mention the clean concurrency model, multi-observer support, and composability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;embracing-using-signalobserver-pairs-directly&quot;&gt;Embracing using signal/observer pairs directly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this architecture, I’ve embraced the imperativeness of UIKit. Using signal/observer pairs blurs the line between reactive and imperative, and is usually seen as a bad thing in the reactive world. In this architecture, I wanted to see if I could supplement UIKit with the most basic building blocks of reactive frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;open-questions&quot;&gt;Open questions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stateful-navigation-flows&quot;&gt;Stateful navigation flows&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, I haven’t yet developed a pattern for implementing stateful navigation flows, specifically collecting and combining data from multiple view controllers to produce one output. I need to spend some time considering ways to implement this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;uikit-as-just-another-framework&quot;&gt;UIKit as just another framework&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As opposed to Soroush’s coordinator implementation, this architecture still lets UIKit run the show with regards to object lifetimes. I’d like to explore the implications of this in more settings. Are there cases where I’m reliant on UIKit lifetime events in a way that’s detrimental to the user experience? Are there other cases where wrestling control away from UIKit provides additional benefits that I’m not thinking of at the moment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-than-just-navigation&quot;&gt;More than just navigation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve intentionally ignored the architecture of data flows beyond saying “data sources can be provided via dependency injection”. In the practice of using this architecture so far I’ve used a few different architectures, the most common being a more looser form of MVVM. I’m still creating a view model for each view controller, but that view model is more or less a helper class of the view controller and the view controller is responsible for communicating with the rest of the app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to explore using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt; signal as the only conduit for dynamic communication into a view controller. Does that increase or decrease complexity? Do view controller lifetime events clutter up the communication channels? Does stricter separation push too much responsibility into the coordinator?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about having both the view controller and the view model have input and output signals and having the coordinator tie them together?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-specialized-reactive-framework&quot;&gt;A specialized reactive framework?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using ReactiveSwift for the plumbing of this architecture provides the benefits of interoperability with the rest of the app and usage of the many built in tools maintained so diligently by the community. However, this architecture has the very specific requirement of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Signal lifetime directly tied to its owner (no termination events).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;0 or more values sent.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s certainly not worth investing time in creating a new framework at this point (although I technically started exploring &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/twocentstudios/CircuitMVVM&quot;&gt;something similar&lt;/a&gt; last year). But at some point it would be interesting to see if the code would be any cleaner and if interoperability could be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-use-ionavigationcontroller-uinavigationcontroller-subclass&quot;&gt;Don’t use IONavigationController (UINavigationController subclass)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s convenient to use configure an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt; from coordinators, but perhaps it would make more sense to create special purpose &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/code&gt; subclasses for each coordinator (that also might solve the stateless navigation problem mentioned above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;is-it-really-worth-it-not-to-use-delegation&quot;&gt;Is it really worth it not to use delegation?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is using an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt; enum and a signal really any better than using a protocol and assigning a delegate? I’d like to find more direct comparisons between the two approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;all-around-naming&quot;&gt;All around naming&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should view controllers interpret meaning in their events before sending them? Should we keep using UI focused prefixes like “tap” in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt; cases? Should the enums be called &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Input&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Outputs&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should these coordinators be called something else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;IONavigationController&lt;/code&gt;’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Inputs&lt;/code&gt;? Should there be another private enum and signal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;blocks-instead-of-signals&quot;&gt;Blocks instead of signals?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would it be possible to replace &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputSignal&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputSignal&lt;/code&gt; with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputBlock?&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputBlock?&lt;/code&gt;? If we’re not using the multi-observer functionality, it could decrease complexity. It would definitely change the all-around syntax of the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve proposed an architecture for controlling application flow in a UIKit-based iOS app using stateless coordinators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to continue working on this architecture in an app (that I may eventually open source) and see if any new patterns emerge. I want to treat this post as a checkpoint and clarify my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Photo/Phono - Your Photos as Music</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My latest app is called Photo/Photo. It’s an iOS app that turns your photos into original musical compositions. It’s an experiment in procedurally/algorithmically generated music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You can download it from the App Store &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-phono/id1202606014?mt=8&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Photo/Phono is pretty simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pick which “composer” module you want to use to transform your photo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select a photo from your photo library.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Listen to a brand new composition composed from the data in your photo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you find a photo and composition pair you like, share it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;video src=&quot;/images/photophono-preview_video.mov&quot; controls=&quot;&quot; preload=&quot;none&quot; poster=&quot;/images/photophono-preview_video_poster.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/photophono-screens.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Walkthrough&quot; title=&quot;Walkthrough&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Walkthrough&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rules&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few basic rules I wanted to abide by while designing the app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compositions are deterministic.&lt;/strong&gt; A particular photo will always return the same composition. There are no outside elements of randomness used to create a composition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compositions are unique.&lt;/strong&gt; This is more of a guideline. No two photos should have the same exact composition. I couldn’t quite guarantee this rule, so in practice you may find visually similar photos may have similar sounding compositions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-does-the-transformation-process-work&quot;&gt;How does the transformation process work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An image is selected. Time to get to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the image is decomposed into various representations of numerical data. Some examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the average red color value of the whole image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the average saturation value of one row of pixels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the number of faces in the image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the dominant colors of the image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This step gives us plenty of raw data to work with. (I go into more detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2016/10/11/images-into-music-deconstruction/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, for each instrument, the algorithm uses the photo data to make decisions on how notes should be created. A note can have a location in the piece, a pitch, a loudness, and a duration. That’s a lot of decisions that need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notes are created in an custom intermediate format that’s a little easier to work with. This allows the algorithm to more easily concatenate bars or sections, with less complexity than is required by the MIDI specification. The basic building block looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoteEvent&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoteNumber&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;velocity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;NoteVelocity&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Beats&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Beats&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have an representation of the piece that contains the notes in bars in sections for each instrument, it can be transformed into MIDI data. But there’s still one more step before our MIDI data will be audible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each composer module is paired with a file called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundFont&quot;&gt;SoundFont&lt;/a&gt;. Since MIDI data is just instructions on how to play the music, a SoundFont is needed to actually generate the sound waves we hear. It’s similar to a piece of sheet music needing an instrument to be played on. The sheet music is just instructions, and it could be played on a grand piano, harpsichord, an upright piano, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, our MIDI data and SoundFont are handed off to the system’s audio frameworks and played back through the speakers or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;but-how-does-the-composing-module-actually-create-the-piece&quot;&gt;But how does the composing module actually &lt;em&gt;create&lt;/em&gt; the piece?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go into more technical detail in &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2016/10/12/image-into-music-transformation/&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, but here is an overview and a bit of background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each composer algorithm works differently. I wanted each algorithm to be free to explore using a palate of data and a canvas of MIDI so to speak. The only two rules are the ones mentioned above regarding being deterministic and being unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, one of my other goals for this project was for the music to be a reflection of the artist creating the algorithm. It was a challenge to myself as a composer and a student of music theory to ask myself: when I sit down to write music, how do I actually &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; it? Would it be possible to enumerate all the different ways I know how to create aesthetically pleasing music and encode those into the computer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that the two composer algorithms I’ve created at first launch are the pinnacle of my abilities. But through the process of designing these, I’ve already learned a lot. And I have a handful of ideas of how I’d like to approach making the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you’re a composer interested in designing your own algorithm for Photo/Photo, please get in touch!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the above reasons and more, I ultimately decided against exploring machine-learning for this project. There’s lots of amazing research in this field (I have a few links below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-notes&quot;&gt;Technical notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I wrote about a few technical challenges creating the sharing feature. Here are posts about &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2017/02/20/bouncing-midi-to-audio-on-ios/&quot;&gt;bouncing MIDI to audio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twocentstudios.com/2017/02/20/creating-a-movie-with-an-image-and-audio-on-ios/&quot;&gt;creating a movie with an image and audio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The UI is only a few screens, but it gave me a chance to experiment with an MVVM+C (Model-View-ViewModel + Coordinator) architecture. I found a couple techniques that worked out well that I’m going to reproduce on future projects.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift&quot;&gt;RxSwift&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift&quot;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/a&gt; on this project. ReactiveSwift was under heavy development when I was getting started, and I also wanted to get some experience with the RxSwift API. I’m probably going to move back to ReactiveSwift for my next project though.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This project is 100% Swift. I love the language itself and especially look forward to writing it in a few years once the language and toolchain have stabilized. Some souring experiences were: going through a somewhat painful Swift 2.2 to 3.0 transition half way through the project, dealing with the frequent loss of autocomplete and syntax highlighting, and slow build times even with my reasonably small codebase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I did all the design work myself, starting with some drawings in my notebook, then moving to a Sketch file. I tried to use some of the newer, bolder iOS 10 aesthetic found in Music.app and News.app.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is the first project I’ve used Auto Layout exclusively (albeit using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jmfieldman/Mortar&quot;&gt;Mortar&lt;/a&gt; helper library). I still find that working directly with frames is more predictable in how long it will take to create a complex layout, whereas implementing a layout using Auto Layout can range from trivial to impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap Up&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting off with the simple idea, “How would you turn a photo into music?” led to solving a lot of interesting problems and learning a lot (while getting to scratch a musical itch). I hope you enjoy the app!&lt;/p&gt;
