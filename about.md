**Hi, I'm Chris.** I'm a software developer living in Yokohama, Japan but originally from Chicago, Illinois.

I like designing and developing products, usually for iOS devices, but sometimes for macOS and the web. I started developing for iOS a little before the release of iOS 3.0 in 2009.

I'm interested in app architecture, UI and UX design, animation, and augmented reality.

I've alternated between company work and releasing apps independently. Several of my apps are open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/twocentstudios).

I've worked at recipe-sharing service [Cookpad](https://cookpad.com), social media nostalgia app [Timehop](https://timehop.com), and revered hand-tool maker [Klein Tools](https://kleintools.com).

A few of my recent independent apps are [Eki Bright](https://apps.apple.com/app/%E9%A7%85%E3%83%96%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88/id6504702463), an app for viewing Tokyo-area station and train timetables; [8-bit Nails](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/8-bit-nails/id6737764793), a pixel art nail diary; [Count Biki](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/count-biki/id6463796779), for drilling numbers in Japanese; [Goalie](https://github.com/twocentstudios/goalie), a bespoke timetracking macOS app; and [Vinylogue](/apps/vinylogue/), a listening history app for [last.fm](https://last.fm).

I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/).

You can contact me via [email](mailto:chris@twocentstudios.com) or [Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@twocentstudios) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/twocentstudios). Check out my open source projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/twocentstudios). I wouldn't bother with [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-trott/19/b64/1b2), but I may respond to messages there some day.
