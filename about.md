Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a software developer originally from Chicago, Illinois.

I like designing and developing products, usually for iOS devices, but sometimes for the web.

I'm interested in functional programming, app architecture, and UI and UX design.

My most recent app is a research project called [Phono/Photo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-phono/id1202606014?mt=8). It turns your photos into original music compositions.

Previously, I worked at [Timehop](http://timehop.com) and [Klein Tools](http://kleintools.com). I also worked on my own iOS apps [Vinylogue](/apps/vinylogue), [BrightBus](/apps/brightbuscu), and several other [projects](/portfolio). I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://www.ece.illinois.edu/).

You can contact me via [email](mailto:chris@twocentstudios.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/twocentstudios). Check out my open source projects on [github](http://github.com/twocentstudios). I wouldn't bother with [linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/christopher-trott/19/b64/1b2).
