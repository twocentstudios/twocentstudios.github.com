    <p>Continuing my series of posts about my latest iOS app, Count Biki, I‚Äôll discuss the planning, design, and character design details.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>I made a big list of every number-adjacent concept in the language and the different modes I wanted to practice.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-enumerating-concepts.jpg" width="" height="400" alt="Brainstorming which topics I could cover and how I could test them" title="Brainstorming which topics I could cover and how I could test them" /><div class="caption-text">Brainstorming which topics I could cover and how I could test them</div></div>

<p>This was a bit overwhelming at first.</p>

<p>I did a bit of prototyping in a Swift Playground to figure out which of Apple‚Äôs APIs ‚Äì speech recognition, numeral-to-text transliteration ‚Äì were feasible to use.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-swift-playground-prototyping.jpg" width="" height="400" alt="Starting in Swift Playgrounds to test out the system APIs" title="Starting in Swift Playgrounds to test out the system APIs" /><div class="caption-text">Starting in Swift Playgrounds to test out the system APIs</div></div>

<p>I decided to start with the flow of:</p>

<ol>
  <li>generate a random number</li>
  <li>speak the number out loud</li>
  <li>the user types the number on a 10-key keyboard</li>
</ol>

<p>My first sketches looked like this:</p>

<h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>

<p>And the first prototype looked like this:</p>

<p>I made a fun little animated barber pole to imply that review sessions were infinite:</p>

<video src="/images/count-biki-animated-barber-pole.mp4" controls="" preload="none" poster="/images/count-biki-animated-barber-pole-poster.png" width="100%"></video>

<p>And cleaned up the design a little bit:</p>

<p>You may have noticed in the top right corner of the above sketch, there‚Äôs a little character I marked ‚ÄúThe Count‚Äù.</p>

<p>I wanted to riff on Duolingo‚Äôs use of characters to motivate the learner and keep the app lighthearted. Duolingo <a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/world-character-visemes/">uses a tool</a> called <a href="https://rive.app/">Rive</a> (although I didn‚Äôt know this at the time). I‚Äôve been dabbling in <a href="https://blender.org">Blender</a> for 3D modeling for the last few years, so I thought I‚Äôd experiment with creating a 3D modeled character with animations and rendering it in the app with Apple‚Äôs native <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/">SceneKit</a> framework.</p>

<p>Of course, this little maneuver set me back a couple weeks üòÖ. And to be clear, adding an animated character to the app was way more of an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm interested in learning something new‚Äù rather than ‚Äúthe app will be useless without this feature‚Äù. However, this did make naming and branding and making an icon for the app way easier!</p>

<h3 id="animated-character-proof-of-concept">Animated character proof of concept</h3>

<p>Before spending an awful lot of time perfecting a character and its animations, I wanted to get a proof of concept working that covered the entire use case end-to-end, namely:</p>

<ol>
  <li>a 3D-character model</li>
  <li>textured with either physically-based shaders or UV-unwrapping on a bitmap</li>
  <li>rigged with at least one bone</li>
  <li>with multiple animations defined in Blender</li>
  <li>with lighting and a camera</li>
  <li>exportable from Blender and importable with Xcode</li>
  <li>displayable in a SceneView in SwiftUI</li>
  <li>with each animation triggerable on demand from a SwiftUI button</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a lot of new concepts for me! Some of the Blender tasks I‚Äôd done once or twice under the guidance of random YouTube tutorials, but the SceneKit integration was completely unknown.</p>

<p>I started by modeling a character with only 3 objects, UV-unwrapping him, and painting the texture.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-blender-proto-modeling.png" width="" height="" alt="Modeling and UV-unwrapping the prototype character" title="Modeling and UV-unwrapping the prototype character" /><div class="caption-text">Modeling and UV-unwrapping the prototype character</div></div>

<p>Then I rigged him with a single bone and added 3 animations (doing my best to understand how the non-linear animation editor worked).</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-blender-proto-animation.png" width="" height="" alt="Rigging and animating the prototype character" title="Rigging and animating the prototype character" /><div class="caption-text">Rigging and animating the prototype character</div></div>

<p>Here‚Äôs the ‚Äúyou got the question incorrect‚Äù animation rendered out of Blender for reference:</p>

<video src="/images/count-biki-blender-proto-incorrect.mp4" controls="" preload="none" poster="/images/count-biki-blender-proto-incorrect-poster.png" width="100%"></video>

<p>Next was probably the hardest part of the entire process: the exporting/importing dance. Like <a href="https://xkcd.com/979/">DenverCoder9</a>, I found only a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/79321?answerId=751657022#751657022">few faint traces</a> on the internet of how I‚Äôd go about getting both a model and its separate animations out of Blender and into SceneKit. I naively followed the instructions from the thread, made some tweaks to the SceneKit file, tweaked the camera and lighting, mocked out a SwiftUI view with some buttons, and the result was:</p>

<video src="/images/count-biki-blender-proto-swiftui.mp4" controls="" preload="none" poster="/images/count-biki-blender-proto-swiftui-poster.png" height="600"></video>

<p>I noticed that the animations were more subdued in app version than they were in the Blender version. I wasn‚Äôt sure why, but I decided to move on since it was a gamble of whether the subtle differences in the production version of the model would surface the same problem.</p>

<h3 id="animated-character-production-version">Animated character production version</h3>

<p>Now that I had a working proof of concept, it was time to do the hard work of actually designing the real character.</p>

<p>First, I did a short interlude of powering through a few character modeling and animation tutorials on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTWV67qUX2k">This long tutorial</a> from Imphenzia was particularly influential and useful.</p>

<p>Like many ideas, I can‚Äôt say exactly where or when all the parts of the Count Biki branding came to me. I knew I wanted to riff on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_von_Count">Count von Count</a> character from Sesame Street. However, I also wanted to incorporate Japanese counters. I always thought Âåπ („Å≤„Åç hiki), the small animals counter, was kind of cute sounding. The version for 3 small animals is pronounced biki („Å≥„Åç).</p>

<p>Why a rabbit? I can‚Äôt remember for sure, but the ironic part is that rabbits are traditionally <em>not</em> counted with Âåπ („Å≤„Åç hiki), but ÁæΩ („Çè wa) due to <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/japanese-counter-wa/#rabbits">rumored historical reasons</a>. Regardless, a cute, vampiric rabbit felt like a unique take.</p>

<p>I did some Dribbble hunting for references and mood board creation, did a few notebook sketches (that are much too embarrassing to post publicly), then began 3D modeling.</p>

<p>My first attempt was‚Ä¶ not great. Luckily, a few friends gave some very useful feedback and my next iteration was much better.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-first-render.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Revised model of Count Biki rendered in Blender" title="Revised model of Count Biki rendered in Blender" /><div class="caption-text">Revised model of Count Biki rendered in Blender</div></div>

<p>I specifically modeled Biki sitting so I could simplify the rig. Rigging ‚Äì adding virtual bones that stretch the polygons and are easier to animate ‚Äì was my next step.</p>

<p>I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how complex rigging is. It may seem like an afterthought, but it‚Äôs an entire division at 3D studios, and for good reason. Below is Biki‚Äôs humble rig showing his suit in weight painting mode.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-rig.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Biki with his rig bones visible" title="Biki with his rig bones visible" /><div class="caption-text">Biki with his rig bones visible</div></div>

<p>With all that in place, I moved on to the animation part. Even though I‚Äôd never done keyframe animation in Blender for a 3D character before, getting the basics done felt surprisingly natural to me. This was probably the most fun part of the entire process.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-blender-animation.jpg" width="" height="" alt="Animating Biki one keyframe at a time" title="Animating Biki one keyframe at a time" /><div class="caption-text">Animating Biki one keyframe at a time</div></div>

<p>The final result for the ‚Äúyou got the answer correct‚Äù animation looked like this straight out of Blender:</p>

<video src="/images/count-biki-blender-animation-correct.mov" controls="" preload="none" poster="/images/count-biki-blender-animation-correct-poster.png" width="100%"></video>

<p>Getting the model and animations out of Blender‚Ä¶ this part was dreadful. I tried so hard to use Apple‚Äôs newest, most blessed workflow of USDZ, but some combination of the Blender exporter and the Xcode importer made this impossible. In the end, I used the same combination of one DAE (Collada) file with just the model and armature, and one DAE file per animation.</p>

<p>I imported the model file into Xcode, creating a new SceneKit scene, then painstakingly re-added the camera, lights, and materials, all of which look and work differently (read: worse) in SceneKit than they do in Blender. I couldn‚Äôt get Biki to look as clean in the app as he does in Blender.</p>

<p>I exported the animations next. When playing them back in the app, I found that some polygons on the suit were getting caught during the animation. This was somewhat expected due to my inexperience modeling and rigging and weight painting. I powered my way through these issues and ended up with the final result: Biki in the test app, playing his idle animation and reacting to questions being answered right and wrong.</p>

<h2 id="app-ux-design">App UX Design</h2>

<p>After integrating Biki and doing a little cleanup, the listening quiz screen looked like this:</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v01-listening-quiz.png" width="" height="700" alt="A beta version of the listening quiz screen including an integrated Biki" title="A beta version of the listening quiz screen including an integrated Biki" /><div class="caption-text">A beta version of the listening quiz screen including an integrated Biki</div></div>

<p>The listening quiz screen was still the ‚Äúbase‚Äù app screen. You could switch to a short list of topics from a modal settings screen, but since this didn‚Äôt seem sustainable for the dozens of topics I wanted to target for v1.0 release, I started preparing to have a new root app screen.</p>

<p>For this app, I was basically doing the static UI design step straight in SwiftUI. The main reason for this is that I was primarily using the build-in SwiftUI components and styling for lists, etc., and therefore it would have taken me more time to make pixel perfect mockup in Figma than it took to throw together some SwiftUI code in Xcode.</p>

<p>I made a topic categories view mockup with some additional features I didn‚Äôt plan on implementing right away. I did this in order to see how the screen could adapt to these planned features. The v1.0 doesn‚Äôt include favorites, recent topics, or the reading skill.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v01-topic-categories-planning.png" width="" height="700" alt="A SwiftUI-based mockup for the topic categories screen with some yet-to-be-developed features" title="A SwiftUI-based mockup for the topic categories screen with some yet-to-be-developed features" /><div class="caption-text">A SwiftUI-based mockup for the topic categories screen with some yet-to-be-developed features</div></div>

<p>Back on the listening screen, I had to make some changes to support the screen no longer being the root of the app. The session settings screen needed a way to exit the current session.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v01-session-settings.png" width="" height="700" alt="The session settings screen with an end session button" title="The session settings screen with an end session button" /><div class="caption-text">The session settings screen with an end session button</div></div>

<p>Next, I added more voice settings for rate and pitch. And a test voice button for easy preview.</p>

<p>Adding a very simple counter for correct and incorrect answers to the listening quiz screen and the session settings screen rounded out all the main UI elements I wanted for the first release.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v02-listening-quiz.png" width="" height="700" alt="The listening quiz screen for v1.0" title="The listening quiz screen for v1.0" /><div class="caption-text">The listening quiz screen for v1.0</div></div>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v02-session-settings.png" width="" height="700" alt="The session settings screen for v1.0" title="The session settings screen for v1.0" /><div class="caption-text">The session settings screen for v1.0</div></div>

<p>Although I knew it‚Äôd delay my first release, I wanted to get an app info screen out of the way. This was mostly because I wanted my in app purchase tip jar system in place out of the gate.</p>

<p>I approached the design of the info screen by checking out what was included in some similar apps, doing a rough UI sketch in my notebook, then jumping straight into coding it up in SwiftUI.</p>

<p>I landed on this:</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v1-info-screen-top.png" width="" height="700" alt="The top of the app info screen for v1.0" title="The top of the app info screen for v1.0" /><div class="caption-text">The top of the app info screen for v1.0</div></div>

<p>I followed the same design process for the in app purchase tip jar screen. I got really into fleshing out the ‚Äúlore‚Äù of the app, and I really wanted to 3D model all the whimsical objects I introduced, but I knew it‚Äôd take some time and wouldn‚Äôt really impact my first batch of users enough to warrant delaying the release any further.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v1-transylvania-tier.png" width="" height="700" alt="The unlocked variant of the Transylvania Tier screen for v1.0" title="The unlocked variant of the Transylvania Tier screen for v1.0" /><div class="caption-text">The unlocked variant of the Transylvania Tier screen for v1.0</div></div>

<p>With the info screen complete, I was ready to release the app! Well, I still needed to do all the App Store preparation: designing screenshots, writing the description, etc.</p>

<div class="caption-wrapper"><img class="caption" src="/images/count-biki-v1-app-screenshots-figma.png" width="" height="" alt="Putting together the app screenshots in Figma" title="Putting together the app screenshots in Figma" /><div class="caption-text">Putting together the app screenshots in Figma</div></div>

<p>My first submission was denied by the App Store reviewers. (I think it was an issue with the in-review in app purchases not being available from the Store Kit 2 API on the reviewer‚Äôs device). I resubmitted with a few more guards, and luckily it was approved and released!</p>

<p>Some initial user feedback helped me realize that my ‚Äúend session‚Äù button shouldn‚Äôt be so buried, especially in the infinite session mode. I did some design concepting with paper sketches and directly in SwiftUI (which in retrospect was probably slower than leaning on Figma).</p>

<p>Honestly, the listening quiz screen is very busy. It has a lot of elements and it‚Äôs tough to look at it with fresh eyes to understand which parts could be removed.</p>

<p>I think that including the Count Biki avatar makes fitting in the other elements more difficult, but I‚Äôm planning to keep him in for at least a few versions to gather feedback about him.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd also like to remove the progress bar completely, but when I add time attack mode, I think it will be necessary, so I don‚Äôt want to eliminate the progress bar now and have to solve the design problem again later.</p>

<p>In the end, I moved the progress bar closer to the keyboard and surfaced the end session and settings buttons with clear labels.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is just the beginning of the design journey. I‚Äôve intentionally leaned towards a generic iOS design, but I would love to make the app more stylized and personable. New topics and new features will undoubtedly require rethinking my original design assumptions. And I‚Äôll need to decide whether I want to double-down on the character Count Biki and add more animations, new outfits, etc.</p>
