    <h1 class="post-title">TDD, RSpec & Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Oct 8, 2012</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p>On my continuing quest to do more micro-projects, I decided to begin focusing on TDD today. After doing a little RSpec Googling, I came across <a href="https://vimeo.com/31403388">this live coding</a> video for doing TDD with RSpec on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life">Conway’s Game of Life</a>, something I hadn’t heard of before.</p>

<p>After watching about half the video, I realized I was far enough along that I could try it myself. So I took a stab at it doing TDD the whole way. It was actually pretty fun doing a simple OO Ruby project and getting my feet wet with RSpec. I’ve always had this ugly feeling of repeating myself with tests, which is one reason I never could bring myself to write tests upfront for my little Rails projects.</p>

<p>It turns out (as everyone knows) that testing actually saves the repetition that comes with hand-testing everything in irb. If I had a nickel for every time I sat there banging away at the keyboard constructing objects and relationships in the Rails console just to do a reload and wipe everything out, I’d be rich (and a cliche).</p>

<p>In any case, it was apparent very quickly that I was really saving myself a lot of headaches by writing tests. The feedback loop was much quicker writing tests first. Fixing bugs and not having to re-establish all of your test setup by hand each time makes it much easier to focus on the bug at hand. And this was just for a three-class micro-project. I can only imagine how much headaches testing saves in large scale Rails projects.</p>

<p>RSpec was actually a lot more intuitive than I expected. It helped that I found an old cheat sheet to kind of guide my thinking of how my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">should</code> statements should be structured. I tried to keep all the best practices in mind while writing my tests, but I’m sure I missed quite a bit on my first run. Looking back, I probably should have had a few more edge case tests especially on the 4 big rules. I’m still getting used to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">describe</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">context</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">before</code>, and all the other structural stuff. It doesn’t help that, from what I’ve seen, there seems to be a personal style to writing tests that varies. It varies in both test structure and amount of testing.</p>

<p>I also forced myself to get a primer on Ruby Debug (using the debugger gem). It’s a little different than I’m used to with the full IDE and the goodies that Xcode offers, but I’m sure it’ll be another useful tool in the toolbox.</p>

<p>I wrote a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cell</code> class and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">World</code> class in what I think was good OO. Then I wrote a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Display</code> class that handles printing the world to the terminal (and even a little animation). I didn’t write tests for that though, it was kind of a just-for-kicks deal.</p>

<p>Sidebar: this actually reminds me a lot of the big project we did in my C++ class Sophomore year of high school. We spent what seemed like several months writing all these classes to simulate fish. I can’t remember exactly what the rules were, but I remember it being a bit tough to wrap my mind around. I don’t think I really understood the difference between UI code and game logic back then. I didn’t get that STDOUT was all we really needed for the concepts we were learning. I kept wanting to understand the GUI classes when all that was in the curriculum were the comp sci basics.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if my code is worth posting to github. I’ll keep it off for now and try to leave room for the more important/interesting projects I’ve got planned.</p>
