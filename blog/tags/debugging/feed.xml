        <title>Vibe Coding a Rental Apartment Search Management App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been apartment hunting here in the Tokyo-area with my girlfriend. We’ve been sending links to various rental property listings back and forth in LINE (messaging app) and emailing with brokers. In a chat interface, it was hard keeping up with the status of each of the properties we’d seen, we wanted to see, we’d inquired about, etc. Classic project management problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-suumo-listing-example.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Example SUUMO property listing page slightly edited for clarity&quot; title=&quot;Example SUUMO property listing page slightly edited for clarity&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Example SUUMO property listing page slightly edited for clarity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to skip the step of putting each property into a shared spreadsheet and jump straight to vibe coding a web app with Claude Code. I’ve never worked on a full-stack TypeScript app before, and my impression is that LLMs are most proficient at it, so that’s what I went with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-finished-desktop-interface.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Finished desktop interface for Bukkenlist&quot; title=&quot;Finished desktop interface for Bukkenlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Finished desktop interface for Bukkenlist&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal was to create a shared space where we could keep track of the status of listings, add new ones easily, do calculations like 2-year amortized cost, keep a notes and ratings field for each of us, see all the salient points of a property at a glance, and archive properties that we decide against or are already taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a day of work, it supported scraping SUUMO listings and worked on mobile and desktop web. Another 2 half-days of work and it supports 4 listing sites, maps, expired listings, and English/Japanese localization. I called it Bukkenlist 物件リスト.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-day1-and-final-comparison.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;App progression from end of day 1 (left) to final polished version (right) - there&apos;s not much visual difference&quot; title=&quot;App progression from end of day 1 (left) to final polished version (right) - there&apos;s not much visual difference&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;App progression from end of day 1 (left) to final polished version (right) - there&apos;s not much visual difference&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was “vibe coding” in the customary definition of “not looking at the generated code at all”. I see the code scrolling past in the terminal window but I’m letting Claude commit it after I check that the rendered result looks and works as intended in the browser window. For this project, I’m playing the role of product manager and QA engineer. However, I did make the decisions about using SQLite for storage, the schema, and the deployment strategy. And I helped Claude dig itself out of holes in the way only an engineer can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; In 2 working days I produced a completely functional web app with much better usability than the spreadsheet it would compete with. Using an AI tool like Claude Code aimed at professionals, it’s hard for me to imagine someone with no coding background being able to get to the same finish line I did. But with the existing cadre of no-code AI tools, perhaps this would be a perfectly scoped project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-full-development-process&quot;&gt;The full development process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a Claude Code $100/mo Max subscription. I used the pattern of using “plan mode” with Opus aggressively to ensure proper context gathering and then “accept edits” mode with Sonnet to execute the plan. These were long sessions, so I actually blew through my usage limits once or twice with 1 or 2 hours remaining (with my usual Swift projects I hadn’t hit the Max limit for Sonnet before). At those times, I switched over to the nascent OpenAI Codex CLI (with a $20/mo Pro plan) to see how it did. Everything about Codex still feels months behind Claude Code, but it did handle some of the tasks I threw at it well enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;day-1&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning from some &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/06/22/vinylogue-swift-rewrite/&quot;&gt;past experiments&lt;/a&gt;, I decided this time to be more intentional with my initial getting-started prompts. I didn’t dump my entire vision for the app onto the model and have it create a full product requirements doc and phase-by-phase development plan. I thought staying in the loop would ensure the best chance of success and even minor scalability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUUMO listing scraping was the most risky part, so I had it start by creating some infrastructure around fetching and parsing the HTML for a few example listings and comparing the results with the values I’d plucked out by hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-console-parsing-results.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Console showing results from the initial SUUMO listing parsing&quot; title=&quot;Console showing results from the initial SUUMO listing parsing&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Console showing results from the initial SUUMO listing parsing&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only after the parsing seemed relatively robust did I have Claude create the initial structure of the Express.js backend and React frontend. It used VITE but I only sort of know what role that plays. The first renderable version was a text field for the SUUMO URL, a submit button, and then a list of the keys and values parsed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-first-working-interface.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;First working interface with URL input field and parsed listing key/values&quot; title=&quot;First working interface with URL input field and parsed listing key/values&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;First working interface with URL input field and parsed listing key/values&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was time to add persistence. This was the part where I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have first decided on hosting, got that set up, &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; decided on the most low maintenance storage solution. Instead, I chose SQLite, which I’ve been interested in lately and have &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/07/02/swift-vapor-fly-io-sqlite-config/&quot;&gt;already deployed&lt;/a&gt; successfully on Fly.io.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my engineer hat on, I made the initial decision to have Claude go with a mixed schema-less approach, storing a generous amount of metadata about each property in named columns, but then having a dumping ground JSON column with all the parsed key/value data. Hard to say whether that’s made my life easier or harder while adding new listing sources. For a personal project with 2 users, I think it was a fine decision. For a real production site, I can already tell it would be a nightmare to maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Final schema of the `scrapes` table
     cid  name           type     notnull  dflt_value  pk

     9    kiyoko_rating  INTEGER  0                    0
     10   chris_rating   INTEGER  0                    0
     11   source_site    TEXT     1        &apos;suumo&apos;     0
     12   color_id       TEXT     0                    0
     13   latitude       REAL     0                    0
     14   longitude      REAL     0                    0
     15   expired        INTEGER  1        0           0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there I had Claude build out the master/detail list in desktop mode. It had little trouble putting together a passible design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-initial-master-detail-view.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Initial master-detail interface showing property list and selected property detail&quot; title=&quot;Initial master-detail interface showing property list and selected property detail&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Initial master-detail interface showing property list and selected property detail&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added delete and refresh support since those were helpful in manual testing. Refresh should re-run the scraping and parsing and replace all the fields with the freshly parsed content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it was kind of the fun part: pushing around the fields in the UI to make it more pretty and readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next I had to add image carousel support which was surprisingly easy. I prompted Claude to do some extra research for best practices before deciding on a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-ui-reorganizing-carousel.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Reorganized UI with image carousel&quot; title=&quot;Reorganized UI with image carousel&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Reorganized UI with image carousel&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added deterministic unique color generation for each property based on its unique ID mapped to a hue value 0-359 in HSV. I use this technique often in projects as a nice touch to make resources easier to identify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-color-id-support.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Properties with unique color IDs for intuitive identification&quot; title=&quot;Properties with unique color IDs for intuitive identification&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Properties with unique color IDs for intuitive identification&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t sightread Japanese as fast as I can English, so I had Claude add full UI localization in both English and Japanese to the entire app and have it save the preference in local storage. This helped speed up QA of parser errors going forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-localization-support.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;English/Japanese localization toggle&quot; title=&quot;English/Japanese localization toggle&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;English/Japanese localization toggle&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to highlight the at-a-glance parts each property that were especially important to the two of us, so I added those in big font next to the image carousel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-at-a-glance-properties.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;First version of the at-a-glance property details&quot; title=&quot;First version of the at-a-glance property details&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;First version of the at-a-glance property details&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it was a lot of polish. I felt like I was in full product manager flow-state, just picking off the next obvious change in the UI and prompting Claude to have a go at it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole point of the app was to facilitate our apartment search process, which ultimately meant appending our own information to listings. I added an open-ended status field to track things like “requested viewing” or “viewing on 8/24”. I added an open-ended notes field for each of us, then a 4-level rating system. In the notes field, we’ve been adding merits/demerits. The rating system is an easy way to clearly communicate our enthusiasm towards each property and see it at a glance in the sidebar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-notes-and-ratings.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;First version of the notes and rating system for each (hardcoded) user&quot; title=&quot;First version of the notes and rating system for each (hardcoded) user&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;First version of the notes and rating system for each (hardcoded) user&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cool feature I’d very loosely prototyped with a single ChatGPT query a few days previously was an “amortized cost” field, calculated from several fields. There are so many disparate fees for each listing (monthly rent, management fees, security deposit, key money, parking fee, etc.) that it’s hard to do an apples-to-apples comparison of how expensive properties actually are. It’s elementary school math, but just annoying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was pretty simple to add this field: parse out the semantic values, multiply the monthly costs by the lease term, add the one-time costs, then divide by the lease term to get the overall monthly cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-all-in-cost.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Amortized cost calculation for true monthly expense comparison&quot; title=&quot;Amortized cost calculation for true monthly expense comparison&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Amortized cost calculation for true monthly expense comparison&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was on the fence about whether to build out a full user table and authentication system. It may have been worth seeing whether Claude could have one-shotted multi-user support. Instead, I opted for a simple password auth and full editing support for any field. I’m pretty happy with this solution and proud of myself for not going overboard on the spec. It’s much easier to share a single password than deal with a create account flow on multiple devices or while on the go. I set some strict rate limits for password attempts and page requests in general and know that if the site gets hacked and trashed somehow it’s not a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-login-screen.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Simple password login screen to gate the whole app&quot; title=&quot;Simple password login screen to gate the whole app&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Simple password login screen to gate the whole app&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was finally time for deployment! I was definitely procrastinating on this, but I wanted to get it online before I went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into some of the common free hosting services that target JS, I realized Vercel was serverless and I’d need a different solution for the SQLite storage. I could have tried Turso for SQLite hosting, but signing up for 2 services felt like too much complexity. I went back to Fly.io since I have some experience with them and an existing account and all the CLI stuff installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude was happy to set up all the deployment stuff and mostly one-shotted it. The big issue came with my underlying scraping implementation. Scraping was based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://playwright.dev/&quot;&gt;Playwright&lt;/a&gt; which needs to spin up a full Chromium instance and that takes 10+ seconds on a 2 GB machine. I have aggressive suspension set for my Fly.io instances which means this heavy startup cost needs to be paid every time a new listing is added. I also didn’t want to pay for a full 2 GB machine on Fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started another vibe spike to replace Playwright with Puppeteer and a lighter Chromium fork based on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-puppeteer-with-nextjs-on-vercel&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; from Vercel. With a lot of trial and error (including rewriting the parser), I got the memory requirement down to 512 MB at the cost of 30+ second scraping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I took a step back and thought about whether I actually needed a full Chromium-based scraper. After all, I’d never actually verified whether these sites were doing enough JS rendering to require it. I don’t have a lot of experience with scrapers and this project was an attempt to fix that. I had Claude do yet another spike with some initial research as to what the most common tools were for low-resource scraping and it chose &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom&quot;&gt;JSDOM&lt;/a&gt;. After rewriting the parser yet again, it turned out this worked fine and was super fast and easily deployable to a tiny 256 MB machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I’d have tried deploying immediately after finishing the very first version of the scraper, I’d have had a much easier time. But I also realized I wouldn’t have had much invested at this point, and my motivation to continue may not have survived this deployment slog. An interesting paradox! In theory I would have saved hours, but in practice I may not have shipped anything. It’s also possible I would have chosen a different deployment service that affected my choice of persistence solution, etc. Decision ordering really matters, and I’m trying to get better at it. But also, LLMs make spikes, backtracking, and rewrites so low-cost/low-effort that as long as you’re willing to ignore sunk costs and your motivation survives you can end up with much more optimal solutions in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-deployed-production-end-day1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;App successfully deployed to production at the end of day 1 (Japanese interface)&quot; title=&quot;App successfully deployed to production at the end of day 1 (Japanese interface)&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;App successfully deployed to production at the end of day 1 (Japanese interface)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first commit was 4pm on Saturday and my last commit before going to sleep was 6am Sunday. I’d (re)watched 3 seasons of Silicon Valley in the background. I sent my girlfriend a link and the password and went to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;day-2--3&quot;&gt;Day 2 &amp;amp; 3&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up a couple hours later and made pancakes and got a message from my girlfriend with links to listings from 2 other services. So it was time to add support for more listing sources!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had Claude do a refactor of the scraper in preparation for adding multi-service support. Again, this was vibe coding so I had no idea how well it did, but I trusted it. This took about an hour. I gave it a link to a new listing and had it run its scraping parsing iterative procedure to write an initial version of the parser. According to the git logs it took about an hour to write the two new scrapers and a guide for itself for writing future scrapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-multi-source-support.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Multi-source support showing listings from different rental websites&quot; title=&quot;Multi-source support showing listings from different rental websites&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Multi-source support showing listings from different rental websites&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized the two of us would need to use my new site from our iPhones, so I added mobile support. This was way way faster than I expected. It took a bit more Claude coercing the next day to get it fully optimized, but the first attempt was definitely usable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-initial-mobile-interface.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Initial mobile interface with separate property list screen (left) and property detail screen (right)&quot; title=&quot;Initial mobile interface with separate property list screen (left) and property detail screen (right)&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Initial mobile interface with separate property list screen (left) and property detail screen (right)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was a half-day. On Monday, I put in another half-day optimizing the mobile layout, adding another source, adding listing expiry support, maps support, and deep linking support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maps support was actually the most difficult single-feature I’d vibe coded for the whole project. Scraping the coordinates for a listing wasn’t too bad, but deciding on the maps provider and implementation was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I was planning on rendering out a static map image on the backend during property add because it seemed simplest and lowest cost. But since I already have an Apple Developer account, using the MapKit JS API was free so I went with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out that Claude had a pretty awful time integrating the MapKit JS library. This is where I ran into a lot of frustration with vibe coding and not having any idea how React works, how JS library loading should work, how environment variables work on the client side, how JS library token authorization should work, and more. I was in thrashing mode with Claude, watching it implement “fixes” that seemed dubious even to me, a JS novice, and inevitably did not work at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to get a lot more hands on and spent a long dev cycle restarting the dev server, deploying to production over and over, copying and pasting browser console logs, and adding and removing secrets from the Fly.io admin page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, we got it working, but it’s hard for me to say &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; Claude struggled so hard with this particular task and how I could have approached it differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/bukkenlist-maps-support.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Map showing the property location and its relationship to closest station&quot; title=&quot;Map showing the property location and its relationship to closest station&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Map showing the property location and its relationship to closest station&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;iteration-loop-workflow&quot;&gt;Iteration loop workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my overall development experience, the local build and serve process was more effortless than iOS, but I found Claude’s new background Bash processes feature frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude would write some code, start a background server, test the code by making some calls to the server, make some code changes, then not realize that the server needed to be restarted and get stuck in a “why isn’t the output changing” loop. I’d need to keep an eye out for this and intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while I took control of starting/stopping the dev server in a separate terminal window, but Claude would ignore this and keep trying to do its own thing. If I was working on this full time I would certainly spend some time making this flow more efficient. I dealt with the paper cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;final-thoughts&quot;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still have at least a few weeks left in the apartment hunting process. The less we need to use this app the happier I will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the time investment, I’d consider this app overkill. It’s useful individually, but for a production app it wouldn’t work as scraping is presumably against the TOSes. The parsing is sloppy. There’s no user account system. There’s no sharing system. There’s no base SaaS functionality. Even individually, it would have taken a lot less time to simply enter the key fields into a spreadsheet manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this was a good experience seeing how feasible vibe coding is for someone with my background. There were several points in the process where I hit that beautiful flow state and really loved it. But there were also stretches where Claude was thrashing and I was losing my patience. Or when I was the tool of the LLM clicking boxes in admin panels or doing visual QA while it was doing the interesting architecture and coding tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing’s for certain: I never would have attempted a project like this without an LLM agent. If I did, I probably would have lost motivation after finishing the first scraper. I probably would have used a technology I already knew even if it was not the most prudent choice in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to try some of the more “batteries included” vibe coding environments (e.g. Lovable, Bolt, Replit, V0) to do a similarly scoped project in the near future. I’m most comfortable with Claude Code at the moment because I’m used to the freedom + sharp edges combination. But it’s hard for me to imagine a non-programmer or even a junior programmer being able to dig themselves out of the holes I found myself in a few times. There’s just a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; to know still to get an MVP designed, developed, and deployed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can see how using a vibe coding environment with less freedom but more well-paved integrations could prevent dead-ends and thrashing and bad developer experience. Maybe within the year both Claude Code and the vibe coding platforms will have converged into providing decent enough support for users of any background.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to Configure Fly.io Managed Postgres with a Swift Vapor App</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I migrated my Swift Vapor app from Fly.io’s regular Postgres to their new Managed Postgres service. As could be expected, this did not go smoothly, so below is a quick guide and the associated debugging story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr-quick-setup-guide&quot;&gt;TL;DR: Quick Setup Guide&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This assumes you’ve already got a working Docker file and you’ve had no issue deploying your Vapor App to Fly.io. (This is not a full Vapor + Fly.io setup walkthrough).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There’s also a chance the below setup is required for other app runtimes as well beyond Vapor, so if you found this via post in anger via search engine, give it a try and see if it fixes your problem.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming that, here is how you create a Managed Postgres instance and connect it to your App:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-flyio-setup-admin-panel&quot;&gt;1. Fly.io setup (admin panel)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open your organization page.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the left sidebar, click “Managed Postgres”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the main content window, click “Create new cluster”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Configure it as necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-find-the-database_url&quot;&gt;2. Find the DATABASE_URL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/fly-managed-postgres-connection-urls.png&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Redacted Managed Postgres Connect page&quot; title=&quot;Redacted Managed Postgres Connect page&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Redacted Managed Postgres Connect page&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the Managed Postgres cluster you just created, click “Connect” in the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;strong&gt;Connection URL&lt;/strong&gt; under the “Connect to your database” header (not the Pooled Connection URL). Pooled Connection URL ignores SSL parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure you &lt;strong&gt;manually add&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?ssl=false&lt;/code&gt; at the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# ✅ Working: Direct Connection URL&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Note: `direct` subdomain AND MANUALLY ADD `?ssl=false`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DATABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;postgres://user:pass@direct.abc123.flympg.net/dbname?ssl&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# ❌ Failed: Pooled Connection URL (ignores ssl=false)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Note: `pgbouncer` subdomain is incorrect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DATABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;postgres://user:pass@pgbouncer.abc123.flympg.net/dbname?ssl&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-add-the-database_url-you-modified-in-2-to-your-app-secrets&quot;&gt;3. Add the DATABASE_URL you modified in (2) to your App Secrets&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Via CLI (&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fly secrets&lt;/code&gt;) or the Fly.io admin panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fly secrets &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;DATABASE_URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;postgres://user:pass@direct.abc123.flympg.net/dbname?ssl=false&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-vapor-configureswift-setup&quot;&gt;4. Vapor &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;configure.swift&lt;/code&gt; Setup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update your Vapor configuration to prefer &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DATABASE_URL&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Configure database - prefer DATABASE_URL if available&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;databaseURL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DATABASE_URL&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databaseURL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;psql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Fallback to individual environment variables&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databases&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;use&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;postgres&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;hostname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;DATABASE_HOST&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;??&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;localhost&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ... other config&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;psql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-deploy&quot;&gt;5. Deploy&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;fly deploy
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-debugging-story&quot;&gt;The Debugging Story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My project is a Swift Vapor (Swift on server) app plus iOS app client called Technicolor. I’ve been working on it on and off for a few years, which means each time I come back to it I have to spent hours or days upgrading all the disparate parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, after 2 years, I came back to the Fly.io deployment. At first, I just wanted to add a migration to the production server to prepare for the TestFlight beta release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying out the deployment, everything seemed to be working at first. But I noticed that the Postgres App that ran alongside the main App in Fly.io “Apps” was now deprecated. Doing some basic reading up on the new offering called Managed Postgres, it seemed like a decent idea to migrate to it while it was on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m still learning the ropes with Claude Code. I &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/06/22/vinylogue-swift-rewrite/&quot;&gt;wrote about&lt;/a&gt; my experience about using Claude Code while rewriting an iOS project. But this is the first time I’ve used it for doing server side work, specifically using the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fly&lt;/code&gt; CLI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the first issue I ran into was that, after deployment, it &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; like the new Managed Postgres instance was up and running fine since the API calls I made were successful. However, it was only after deleting the now obsoleted Postgres App instance that I realized the ENV vars were still pointing the server to the old database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Claude Code was happy enough trying to debug the issue by tweaking random values and doing lots of 5+ minute deploys (I kept it on a long leash for a while to see how it handled the debugging). It did seem to get lucky a couple times and read the server logs at just the right time to discover the above problem (old database URL). It also eventually discovered there was an SSL error with the new database URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But from there it had no chance. I had to consult a bunch of other sources, many outdated, and take the reins back. I looked through the Vapor/Fluent source code to see which SSL parameters were now valid. I made a checklist of database URL variations I needed to try, updated the ENV var, waited for the deploy, and checked the logs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I did discover a URL that worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real talk: I honestly feel like Vapor was fun as a learning experience. You get to sling Swift. You get to share the model transport layer with server and client. You get to get into the weeds a bit more than a fully scaffolded solution with a plethora of drop in frameworks that solve every imaginable  problem and use case. But the community required to support a vibrant developer ecosystem has never showed up after all these years. That means that all the &lt;a href=&quot;https://xkcd.com/979/&quot;&gt;DenverCoder9&lt;/a&gt; problems I’m normally fine debugging myself in iOS land because it’s my main focus, I’m a hopeless case in server-land. Using some JS framework or Rails is playing the much better odds that someone will have already found and solved your bug and wrote a post like this one before you did. Does that mean I’m going to rewrite the backend of this project? Not yet, but maybe one or two more of these heisenbugs and I’m going to have to cut my losses.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Caveats Using Read-only SQLite Databases from the App Bundle</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In my iOS apps &lt;a href=&quot;/2025/06/03/eki-live-announcement/&quot;&gt;Eki Live&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twocentstudios.com/2024/07/27/eki-bright-tokyo-area-train-timetables/&quot;&gt;Eki Bright&lt;/a&gt; I’ve been using read-only SQLite databases shipped in the app bundle. It’s mostly worked fine so far (disregarding the &lt;a href=&quot;https://ryanashcraft.com/sqlite-databases-in-app-group-containers/&quot;&gt;App Group Containers&lt;/a&gt; problem).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My workflow involves:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Running a Swift script from a separate target that aggregates several &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; files into an &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Copying the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; file to the app target; it gets included in the app bundle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Opening the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite&lt;/code&gt; file as read-only on app launch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Opening an sqlite database from the bundle using the venerable GRDB library&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;guard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;databasePath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;forResource&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;db&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ofType&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sqlite&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fatalError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Database not found in bundle&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;readonly&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;database&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;DatabaseQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;databasePath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to now, I had unwittingly avoided any problems with the write-ahead log (WAL) journaling mode because the database generated by the script was created as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DatabaseQueue&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DatabasePool&lt;/code&gt;, and otherwise did not inherit any settings via backup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Eki Live, I started using a read-write database to record GPS datapoints while out riding trains that I could play back in a bespoke app on my Mac. I again unwittingly avoided any problems with journaling mode because I was taking the intermediate step of processing this read-write database in a Swift script that produced a flat &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;json&lt;/code&gt; file. The Swift script maintained read-write access to the file system because it ran from a target without a bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My luck finally ran out when I decided to refactor my system to skip that intermediate step: I wanted to be able to export a read-write database from the Eki Live iOS app, include it in the bundle of the macOS debug app, and run it as read-only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying this, SQLite threw errors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;os_unix.c:49450: (2) open(../viewer.app/Contents/Resources/db.sqlite-wal) - No such file or directory
SQLite error 14: unable to open database file - while executing `SELECT * FROM sqlite_master LIMIT 1`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can check and change the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.sqlitecloud.io/journal-modes-in-sqlite&quot;&gt;journal mode&lt;/a&gt; of a database in SQLite with the following terminal commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-zsh highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Check the journal mode of the database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sqlite3 db.sqlite &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;PRAGMA journal_mode;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
wal &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# this mode can cause problems when opening the database from a read-only part of the file system&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Change the journal mode of the database&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sqlite3 db.sqlite &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Check the journal mode of the database again&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;gp&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;sqlite3 db.sqlite &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;PRAGMA journal_mode;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
delete &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# as long as we open the database in readonly mode, there&apos;s no problem with delete mode&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Manually changing the journal mode to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; via the command line before copying the database to the app bundle solved my problem. However, I wanted to ensure any database I exported from the iOS app would be easily importable by the macOS app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the working export function from the iOS app that includes resetting the journal mode to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; for the exported database:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;exportDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sourceDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;DatabaseReader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;UUID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;uuidString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;_&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;formatted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;iso8601&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temporaryDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;appending&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;appendingPathExtension&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;sqlite&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;DatabaseQueue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Note: `backup` changes the journal mode of `targetDatabase`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sourceDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;backup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Optional: make any changes to the target database contents before exporting&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Ensure database size is as compact as possible after any deletes&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;vacuum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Change the journal mode from `wal` to `delete`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;writeWithoutTransaction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;sql&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Housekeeping&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above code, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/code&gt; actually &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; created in journal mode &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt;. However, it’s the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt; command that changes the journal mode of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;targetDatabase&lt;/code&gt; to match that of the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sourceDatabase&lt;/code&gt; (which, as read-write, is &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wal&lt;/code&gt; as intended). In retrospect, that makes sense I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, on the macOS app side, I tried copying the database from the bundle into the documents directory before opening it, but ran into the same problem with a “missing .sqlite-wal file”. I think because I hadn’t been properly closing the exported database and wasn’t including the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;wal&lt;/code&gt; file in the export, sqlite was getting confused. This is still a bit of a mystery though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll also note it’s possible to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html#vacuuminto&quot;&gt;VACUUM INTO&lt;/a&gt; in place of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BACKUP&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;VACUUM&lt;/code&gt;. However, in my use case, I need to optionally remove some data from the target database before returning it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using improperly maintained sqlite databases in a read-only context is probably a rare problem, but hopefully the info in this post helps other sqlite novices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Journal mode is embedded in the sqlite database file itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt; command changes the journal mode of the target database to match the source database.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the journal mode of a database with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite3 db.sqlite &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the journal mode of a database with &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sqlite3 db.sqlite &quot;PRAGMA journal_mode=DELETE;&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Reminder: Conditional Breakpoints are Slow</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it’s obvious that conditional breakpoints in LLDB add noticeable execution latency, but it was a lesson I needed to relearn. And relearning this lesson is fun debugging story to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context of this story is specifically Swift Error breakpoints, which obscured the root cause of the issue long enough to cause me some serious emotional damage. Despite the lasting trauma, it was a happy ending because the fix required no code changes and no emergency app submissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tldr&quot;&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift Error breakpoints with type filters or conditions can dramatically slow down execution when errors are thrown in a tight loop.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disable conditional Swift Error breakpoints when you are not actively debugging with them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider not using error handling for control flow in cases where the error handling could end up in a tight loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;issue-and-symptoms&quot;&gt;Issue and symptoms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During normal development, I noticed slow startup and noticeable hitching when navigating to and from screens that made database fetches. However, outside the normal build/run cycle, the hitching would disappear and the app would run quickly and smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/conditional-breakpoint-station-load.gif&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;Loading speed of the station timetable screen on the simulator after a build and run (it was twice as slow on device)&quot; title=&quot;Loading speed of the station timetable screen on the simulator after a build and run (it was twice as slow on device)&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Loading speed of the station timetable screen on the simulator after a build and run (it was twice as slow on device)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem appeared somewhat randomly and at first was not severe enough to disrupt my usual development cycle outside being a little annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After adding more features, the problem gradually became so pronounced that I could no longer debug normally. I would build and run to install the app, then immediately stop debugging and re-launch the app in order to continue testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some light investigation throughout the subsequent weeks of development, but I never spent enough time to discover the root cause as I wanted to focus on shipping &lt;a href=&quot;/2024/08/06/eki-bright-developing-the-app-for-ios/&quot;&gt;Eki Bright&lt;/a&gt; to the App Store. At this point I had only confirmed that the issue was present:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In both Debug and Release build configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In both the iOS simulator and on device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;root-cause&quot;&gt;Root cause&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the full story, a TL;DR on root cause of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;swift-error-breakpoints&quot;&gt;Swift Error breakpoints&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xcode/LLDB has a useful breakpoint type for Swift errors. A fresh Swift Error breakpoint will pause execution when any error is thrown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/conditional-breakpoint-add-menu.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; alt=&quot;All the breakpoint types you can add in Xcode 15.4&quot; title=&quot;All the breakpoint types you can add in Xcode 15.4&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;All the breakpoint types you can add in Xcode 15.4&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a Swift Error breakpoint can be conditional to a specific error type.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/conditional-breakpoint-swift-error-edit.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;Swift Error breakpoints also include a Type filter&quot; title=&quot;Swift Error breakpoints also include a Type filter&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;Swift Error breakpoints also include a Type filter&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;grdb&quot;&gt;GRDB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift&quot;&gt;GRDB&lt;/a&gt; is a “toolkit for SQLite databases”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GRDB has a useful feature called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/dd6b98ce04eda39aa22f066cd421c24d7236ea8a/README.md#codable-records&quot;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/blob/dd6b98ce04eda39aa22f066cd421c24d7236ea8a/README.md#json-columns&quot;&gt;JSON Columns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When a Codable record contains a property that is not a simple value (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.), that value is encoded and decoded as a JSON string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This feature makes it simple and boilerplate-free to use embedded JSON in the context of traditional SQL tables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deep in the implementation details, GRDB uses Swift errors to fall back to JSON decoding when a column is not decodable as a simple value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// GRDB/Record/FetchableRecord+Decodable.swift&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// The decoder that decodes from a database column&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ColumnDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Decoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keyedBy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;KeyedDecodingContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We need to switch to JSON decoding&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;JSONRequiredError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// The decoder that decodes a record from a database row&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_RowDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Decoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;databaseJSONDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;stringValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONRequiredError&lt;/code&gt; is used for control flow. When decoding dozens of rows with several JSON columns, this error will be thrown hundreds of times from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ColumnDecoder&lt;/code&gt; but caught and handled immediately in the caller &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_RowDecoder&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;swift-error-breakpoint--grdb&quot;&gt;Swift Error breakpoint + GRDB&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time GRDB would throw a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONRequiredError&lt;/code&gt;, the debugger would check a Swift Error breakpoint with the unrelated type filter &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;train-timetable.AppDatabaseClient.Error&lt;/code&gt; I had set during feature development and forgotten about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the &lt;em&gt;throw-error-check-breakpoint&lt;/em&gt; procedure happened hundreds of times for certain queries, the result was a noticeable lag that appeared in the UI more and more as I added more features to the app and therefore database fetches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;fix&quot;&gt;Fix&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fix was literally just disabling the Swift Error breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;full-debugging-story&quot;&gt;Full debugging story&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I do not enjoy living through a good debugging story, I enjoy telling a good debugging story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documenting your bug investigation can feel slow, but it helps so much in retrospect to develop better instincts for next time. Doing so in a simple text log allowed me to write the following tale as it actually happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;measuring&quot;&gt;Measuring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step was narrowing down which area of the code was affected. Although almost all screens in my app use the database, the About screen does not, and did not show any sort of hitches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I re-ran a measurement test on both device and simulator that I had previously written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;testMeasureDatabaseFetch&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ync&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;measure&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;AppDatabaseClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;liveValue&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;expectation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Task&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fetchStationTimetable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;stationID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Minatomirai.Minatomirai.Bashamichi&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;railDirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inbound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;scheduleSelector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;weekday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fulfill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;wait&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;exp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I confirmed that this simple fetch was taking between 1.5 and 3.0 seconds when there’s no way it should be taking more than 0.01 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enabled database tracing in GRDB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;dbLogger&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Logger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;subsystem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Bundle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bundleIdentifier&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;category&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;db&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Configuration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prepareDatabase&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;trace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;profile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dbLogger&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;warning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Slow query: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;event&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This helped me keep an eye on query times throughout my investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;poking-the-database&quot;&gt;Poking the database&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Slow query: 1.491s SELECT * FROM &quot;station&quot; WHERE &quot;id&quot; IN (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I noticed was that I was erroneously submitting way too many keys to the query when doing my ad-hoc database joins. However, after uniquing the keys, the query time didn’t change. After all, if that were the issue I’d see it in production too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought perhaps reading the database from the bundle could be the problem. But that setup is tacitly endorsed in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://swiftpackageindex.com/groue/grdb.swift/v6.29.0/documentation/grdb/databaseconnections#Opening-a-Connection&quot;&gt;GRDB quickstart&lt;/a&gt;. And again, I’d presumably see this problem in production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, almost all the hypotheses I had at first didn’t make sense when considering this problem only appeared in the build/run cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another symptom I noticed due to the database logging was that the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;EntityQuery&lt;/code&gt; I’d added when creating the widget extension was being called several times during app launch. This explained why app launch became unbearably slow at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-debugger&quot;&gt;The debugger&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I decided to fire up Instruments and do some profiling. But I couldn’t reproduce the problem with the default Instruments setup. I even changed the build configuration from the default of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; and still no change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was my first clue that the debugger was involved. But how could I confirm this? Well, I found two ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first was disabling the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Debug executable&lt;/code&gt; option in the Scheme settings under &lt;em&gt;Run&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/conditional-breakpoint-debug-executable.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;You can prevent Xcode from automatically attaching the debugger when running in the Scheme settings&quot; title=&quot;You can prevent Xcode from automatically attaching the debugger when running in the Scheme settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;You can prevent Xcode from automatically attaching the debugger when running in the Scheme settings&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Without the debugger attached, the issue was fixed!&lt;/strong&gt; This was a useful discovery. If I had to stop here, I could at least workaround the issue at the cost of not being able to use the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second confirmation of the debugger’s role in the issue would be useful later on in the investigation. It turns out you can manually attach a debugger to an app being profiled in Instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;caption-wrapper&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;caption&quot; src=&quot;/images/conditional-breakpoint-attach-debugger.jpg&quot; width=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; alt=&quot;You can manually attach/detach the debugger to/from a running process in Xcode&quot; title=&quot;You can manually attach/detach the debugger to/from a running process in Xcode&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-text&quot;&gt;You can manually attach/detach the debugger to/from a running process in Xcode&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rabbit-holes&quot;&gt;Rabbit holes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d like to say at this point I quickly narrowed down the problem even further. But unfortunately, I went down some unrelated rabbit holes. Yet those rabbit holes eventually led me to another useful discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few stray pieces of advice I noticed while Googling prompted me to completely purge derived data, but that made no difference. I’d done this previously when testing whether the issue was fixed in Xcode 16 beta (it was not).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dug deeper into the extensive GRDB docs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tried switching from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DatabaseQueue&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DatabasePool&lt;/code&gt;. No change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tried switching from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db.read&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db.unsafeRead&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;config.allowsUnsafeTransations&lt;/code&gt;). No change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tried adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;await&lt;/code&gt; in front of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;db.read&lt;/code&gt;. No change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I stepped through the execution of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station.fetchAll(_:keys:)&lt;/code&gt; and didn’t see anything too strange.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I changed my database calls to fetch all results (~2000) instead of just those for a few keys. The fetch time went up from 3 seconds to 30 seconds. This was actually a good clue that &lt;strong&gt;the slowdown scaled linearly with the number of results&lt;/strong&gt;. Although I didn’t yet know what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I successfully attached the debugger to the app while profiling in Instruments. Strangely, I saw long calls to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;read&lt;/code&gt;, but the trace went dead there. Plus, the raw function duration values/weights looked normal. Instruments also highlighted a long hang during that period, which re-raised another lingering question: &lt;strong&gt;why was the UI hanging when the entire database fetch was happening on a background queue?&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning to the normal debugger, the extra long query generated by fetching all stations allowed me to pause execution during the database fetch. I had to hammer on the pause button in Xcode for it to “catch”, but when it did, I usually ended up in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ColumnDecoder&lt;/code&gt; struct mentioned earlier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// The decoder that decodes from a database column&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;ColumnDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Decoder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;keyedBy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;Type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;KeyedDecodingContainer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We need to switch to JSON decoding&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;JSONRequiredError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;/// &amp;lt;--- execution usually paused here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When pausing execution randomly as opposed to using a breakpoint, you can’t rely on landing in a relevant section of the code. However, in this case, stepping through and exploring this section of GRDB source showed me two important points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GRDB was intentionally using errors for control flow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should look into GRDB’s JSON column decoding support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;grdbs-json-column-decoding-support&quot;&gt;GRDB’s JSON column decoding support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I noticed my &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/code&gt; model had two JSON columns, one of which I’d added later in development (in retrospect, another decision that unwittingly exacerbated the slowdown).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Sendable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;railDirections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RailDirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/code&gt; is a super simple two-String struct and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;RailDirection&lt;/code&gt; is an enum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Sendable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;enum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RailDirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;CaseIterable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Comparable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Sendable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inbound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Inbound&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outbound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Outbound&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I disabled temporarily decoding for these two columns by setting their values to constants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Sendable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;en&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ja&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;railDirections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;RailDirection&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;inbound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;outbound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disabling decoding for the JSON columns fixed the slowdown!&lt;/strong&gt; This was another big breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to summarize, at this point I had the following facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Instruments time profile looked normal besides the hang.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The debugger was involved somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GRDB’s JSON column decoding support was involved somehow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-just-the-debugger-but-also-breakpoints&quot;&gt;Not just the debugger, but also breakpoints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew the debugger was my enemy, but I was now using it heavily to pause, step in and out and over code, and set breakpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point while stepping through GRDB code, I thought I was losing my mind. In my normal course of debugging I’d clicked the little “disable breakpoints” button in Xcode debug area header. Sometime later I noticed I could no longer reproduce the slowdown no matter what code I added or removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily I connected the dots and realized that it was disabling breakpoints that solved the slowdown. I’d successfully narrowed down the problem from &lt;em&gt;debugger&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;breakpoint&lt;/em&gt;. But now what? Googling “how are breakpoints implemented in LLDB” was obviously a dead end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;back-to-grdb&quot;&gt;Back to GRDB&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my two front war, I switched back to focusing on GRDB. I re-read the docs and tried a few small code tweaks to see if it was a model configuration problem on my end. After all, I’d written a lot of this code several months ago and probably moved on once it apparently worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tried adding &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/code&gt; conformance to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/code&gt;, but that didn’t change anything and it didn’t make sense anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tried adding manual &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/code&gt; implementations to both &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/code&gt;. No change.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I tried adding my own &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/code&gt; via the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;static func databaseJSONDecoder(for column: String) -&amp;gt; JSONDecoder&lt;/code&gt; method on the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/code&gt; protocol. No change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried manually decoding the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/code&gt; with my own one-off &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-swift highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Equatable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Sendable&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;decoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;Decoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;decoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;keyedBy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;CodingKeys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;titleString&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;container&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;forKey&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;titleData&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;titleString&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;utf8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;decode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;titleData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a bit unintuitive because the top-level decoder from &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Station&lt;/code&gt; is not a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/code&gt;; it’s a custom decoder from GRDB to decode a row of SQL data. I’m then manually creating a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/code&gt; to decode the raw string column as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TitleLocalization&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somewhat as expected, bypassing the error-throwing logic in GRDB and &lt;strong&gt;using my own JSON decoding solved the slowdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;reconnaissance-and-rest&quot;&gt;Reconnaissance and Rest&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been investigating for about 6 hours straight and was starting to lose my mind, yet I felt so close to finding the underlying problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I was considering a few paths forward for the next day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workaround: give up using breakpoints indefinitely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Workaround: rewrite my model layer’s &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Codable&lt;/code&gt; support to manually decode all JSON columns, but in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DEBUG&lt;/code&gt; mode only.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ask for help: create a sample project that showed a minimal reproduction of the bug and share it in an Issue on the GRDB GitHub repo.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Forge ahead: continue investigating on my own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I hung it up for the day I wrote and shared a short &lt;a href=&quot;https://hachyderm.io/@twocentstudios/112920118896935621&quot;&gt;cry-for-help post&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While writing the Mastodon post, I realized that I could leave the breakpoints feature enabled, but &lt;strong&gt;disable the individual breakpoints in the breakpoint panel and the slowdown was solved&lt;/strong&gt;. This led me to notice I had left a Swift Error breakpoint on that I’d must have added several weeks back and forgot about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exasperated, I shared a few of the salient discoveries to my friend and fellow iOS dev Dave Fox. He asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So it’s purely down to that custom [Swift Error] breakpoint?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without checking because I was now away from the computer, I responded, no, it was any breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had dinner and went to bed, the investigation still stewing somewhere in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-solution&quot;&gt;The solution&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up in the middle of the night and in a delirious state and the two pieces of the puzzle had suddenly come together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I actually &lt;em&gt;hadn’t&lt;/em&gt; checked whether it was only the Swift Error breakpoint that caused the slowdown (triggered by Dave’s question).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The GRDB JSON column decoding implementation throws errors as normal control flow.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The number of errors thrown by GRDB would increase linearly with the number of rows and JSON columns.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My decoding workaround did not throw any errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got up and went to the computer and turned off the Swift Error breakpoint while leaving the other breakpoints on. &lt;strong&gt;The slowdown was fixed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution finally made sense: LLDB conditionally type checking every error thrown by GRDB during JSON column decoding was taking significant time and adding up enough to be noticeable. Even though the decoding was happening off the main queue, the debugger was still locking up the entire app while it was processing the breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, I solved the underlying problem. The problem caused no issues for my end users (besides slowing down my ability to ship new features) and required no code changes. I literally just needed to delete a breakpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;retrospective&quot;&gt;Retrospective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I look back and wonder, could I have solved this earlier? What heuristics can I incorporate into my future debugging investigation procedure? What can I do to proactively prevent an issue shaped like this in the future?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bug with the debugger as the root cause was new to me. I think it showed a weakness in my overall understanding of LLDB. Based on my awareness that Release builds are always faster than Debug builds (and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/1173&quot;&gt;this issue&lt;/a&gt; from the GRDB repo, seemingly resigning to that fact), my assumption was that the root cause was the Debug build configuration. Although following that thinking, that couldn’t have been it because there was no slowdown after the debugger was detached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another ambiguous point I should have clarified early on in the investigation: did the query trace times reported by SQLite include only time spent inside the SQLite library or did they also include time spent in GRDB while a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;TRANSACTION&lt;/code&gt; was still open? The answer was the latter, and knowing that definitively would have allowed me to investigate GRDB internals with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rabbit holes I went down were time consuming, but ultimately, pulling any string was enough to stumble upon insights that got me to the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quickest path to the solution would have been:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slowdown does not occur when debugging with Instruments in the Debug build configuration.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;→ must be related to the debugger.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slowdown does not occur when Xcode does not attach the debugger.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;→ debugger-related confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slowdown does not occur when breakpoints are disabled at runtime.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;→ must be related to breakpoints.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slowdown does not occur when breakpoints are enabled but no individual breakpoints are disabled.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;→ must be an individual breakpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slowdown does not occur when a normal breakpoint is enabled but a conditional breakpoint is not enabled.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;→ must be the conditional breakpoint.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The slowdown occurs when only the conditional breakpoint is enabled.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;→ conditional breakpoint root-cause confirmed.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big missing piece in being able to jump to each conclusion was the understanding of &lt;em&gt;what components make up a debugger?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I would have thought: “A debugger’s primary component tools are viewing memory, viewing thread state, viewing the stack frame, setting breakpoints, setting watchpoints, and executing statements”, it may then have been obvious, either right away or through process of elimination, that a way the debugger could directly affect execution was through breakpoints or watchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I think most programmers feel instinctual dread when they suspect the bug they’re investigating &lt;em&gt;changes its behavior when it’s being observed&lt;/em&gt;. The quantum nature of these bugs is why we call them &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heisenbugs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I was admittedly slow in connecting the dots along the debugger line of inquiry, I do give myself credit for recognizing that GRDB was using errors for control flow and filing that away as notable in the back of my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps I should have jumped first to trying to reproduce the slowdown in a clean room project. However, in this particular case I believe that approach would have been counterproductive and taken longer to find the root cause. The clean room project would have taken time to build up to the complexity of main app, and at that point would still not have any chance of recreating the issue (because I would not have noticed the offending breakpoint still in the main app).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This experience was a good opportunity to spelunk through the docs and extensive codebase of GRDB. Spelunking through unfamiliar codebases is itself a muscle that must be stretched regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been nicer to have solved this issue in one hour instead of six (plus the weeks I spent working around it). But I am satisfied I discovered the root cause in one session (plus sleep).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you’ve stored this tidbit about the relative slowness of conditional breakpoints away in your memory alongside all the other great Xcode trivia, and you’ll recognize this issue immediately should you ever come across it. Hopefully you enjoyed the story, and I hope I don’t have another one like it for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
