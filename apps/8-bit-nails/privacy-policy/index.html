        <p>8-bit Nails is an iOS app created by twocentstudios.</p>

<p>This policy describes the data that we collect and store about you (basically none).</p>

<p>We do not collect any user input or preferences from the app. All settings are stored locally on your device.</p>

<p>If you email us for support or for any other reason, we will have your email address, but we will only use it for the duration of answering your request. We will remove your email address on request.</p>

<p>If you provide payment within the app using Appleâ€™s in app purchase functionality, we will not have access to any information about you.</p>

<p>We will have access to some anonymized data like crash reports and performance metrics through standard Apple systems, configurable at the operating system level of your device. This applies to all apps, and you may opt out of this in iOS settings.</p>

<p>Please contact support@twocentstudios.com for any additional information.</p>
