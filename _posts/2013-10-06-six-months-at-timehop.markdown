It was about six months ago I started contracting at [Timehop](http://timehop.com). After six weeks of remote work from Chicago, I decided to move to New York City to join the team full time.

In late June, I packed up a small U-Haul truck with most of my belongings. My friend Sergio and I drove that truck 14 hours across the mid-west.

I've learned a lot in the past six months, most of it from my co-workers, but some of it from banging my head against a wall until late into the evening. I've pushed some solid code and some buggy code to the App Store.

I've had the chance to write features that hundreds of thousands of people will interact with every day. I've also had the chance to prototype features and tweak them to get them just right.

I've been to a few meetups, and I've met some really cool developers. I've met some new friends, and I've stayed as close as I can with those back in Chicago (I'm not sure how we'd do it without FaceTime and Google Hangouts).

It would take me the rest of the year to finish this post if I tried to get anymore specific about all the things I've done in the past six months. I think it suffices to say that the adventure has just begun. I'm really excited about what's ahead.
