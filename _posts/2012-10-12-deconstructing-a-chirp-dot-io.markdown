#### UPDATE (10/13/12): The kind folks at chirp.io pointed me to their [tech page](http://chirp.io/tech). Read more at the end of the post.

_TL;DR: I tried to figure out the chirp.io sound->URL protocol but failed._

I came across an interesting app today called [chirp.io](http://chirp.io). From the chirp.io website:

> Chirp is an incredible new way to share your stuff – using sound. Chirp sings information from one iPhone to another.

Just reading about it, I was very impressed. It's not easy to encode a few hundred kilobytes of data (small jpeg) into a sound. But in the App Store blurb, it says:

> Sharing requires a network connection.

Oh, so it's actually just transmitting a link. Still pretty cool.

I downloaded the app and played a few of the example chirps. I noticed that they were relatively high pitched and seemed to be the same length. I also noticed they were monophonic - only one frequency was played at a time.

By tapping on a chirp, it shows what is basically a short URL for that resource. An example is `chirp.io/gsm2h88c7u` which links back to `chirp.io/blog`. You can also share images and text.

I did some similar DSP and frequency detection projects in college, so I decided to see if I could reverse engineer the protocol that chirp.io uses. I'm definitely no codebreaker or cryptographer, but we'll see how far we can get.

## Busting out the DAW

I usually use [Magix Samplitude](http://www.samplitude.com) as my Digital Audio Workstation of choice, but since I was booted up on my OS X side, I decided to use cross-platform [Reaper](http://reaper.fm) instead.

The first thing I needed to do was record the waveform. I could have direct connected into my sound card using a 3.5mm to 3.5mm jack, but I didn't have one of those handy. I did have my Shure KSM27 set up, so I decided to record it through the air instead.

The first chirp I analyzed was `chirp.io/gsm2h88c7u`. If you notice, the short URL is only 10 characters long. We may be able assume that it uses lowercase characters a-z and 0-9.

{% caption_img /images/chirp-2.png One monophonic segment of the chirp %}

If you count, there are 20 monophonic segments in the chirp. Each segment is around 88ms long.

Reaper has a pitch detector plug-in, so I looped each segment and estimated the frequencies. The pitch detector plug-in sometimes got confused though, so I had to double check with a normal FFT.

## Looking at the data

I recorded the data for this first chirp:

	chirp1 = [4717, 5300, 4453, 8981, 6324, 
				1976, 4717, 2797, 2797, 3522, 
				2640, 10000, 3737, 9400, 6660, 
				3965, 4189, 2220, 7131, 5613]
		
Those are the 20 frequencies in Hz in the order they're played.

With only one data point so far, I decided to make an initial hypothesis:

* Points 8 and 9 are the same (2979Hz) so maybe that divides the chirp into a metadata section and a URL section.
* The unique URL part is 10 characters so maybe that's sections 10-19 and 20 is the stop bit.

I can't do much with only one data point, so I analyzed a second chirp. This one is a short text block with the URL `chirp.io/mnac2dvevb`.

	chirp2 = [4717, 5300, 6324, 6660, 3143, 
				3522, 1976, 3737, 10844, 3965, 
				10844, 3329, 5000, 4717, 2797, 
				6660, 4189, 2098, 3965, 2220]
	
Hmm… not as much correlation as I expected. Let's look at them side by side.

	1	4717	4717
	2	5300	5300
	3	4453	6324
	4	8981	6660
	5	6324	3143
	6	1976	3522
	7	4717	1976
	8	2797	3737
	9	2797	10844
	10	3522	3965
	11	2640	10844
	12	10000	3329
	13	3737	5000
	14	9400	4717
	15	6660	2797
	16	3965	6660
	17	4189	4189
	18	2220	2098
	19	7131	3965
	20	5613	2220
	
The only thing that stands out at first glance is segments 1 and 2 are the same. That would make sense as our start code.

Let's combine these two sets, sort them, then discard the duplicates.

	uniq_freqs = [1976, 2098, 2220, 2640, 2797, 
					3143, 3329, 3522, 3737, 3965, 
					4189, 4453, 4717, 5000, 5300, 
					5613, 6324, 6660, 7131, 8981, 
					9400, 10000, 10844]

Between the two chirps, there are 23 unique frequencies. So frequencies are shared quite a bit.

Now let's subtract the neighbors to try to figure out how many we're missing.

	diff_freqs = [122, 122, 420, 157, 346, 
					186, 193, 215, 228, 224, 
					264, 264, 283, 300, 313, 
					711, 336, 471, 1850, 419, 
					600, 844]
	
I'd guess that we're missing a couple from the low range, but a few more in the higher range. I expect the differences to increase as the we get higher up the scale, but that really depends on the frequency detection algorithm being used by the app.

It seems like we're kind of stuck. My initial hypothesis is mostly wrong. It doesn't look like frequencies map directly to letters. Let's do one more chirp before we give up.

	chirp3 = [4717, 5300, 2963, 4453, 4189, 
				2490, 7922, 2963, 5945, 9400, 
				10000, 2098, 7922, 5945, 7521, 
				3965, 8981, 5000, 4717, 2098] 

	1	4717	4717	4717
	2	5300	5300	5300
	3	4453	6324	2963
	4	8981	6660	4453
	5	6324	3143	4189
	6	1976	3522	2490
	7	4717	1976	7922
	8	2797	3737	2963

	18	2220	2098	5000
	19	7131	3965	4717
	20	5613	2220	2098
	
	uniq_freqs = [1976, 2098, 2220, 2490, 2640, 
					2797, 2963, 3143, 3329, 3522, 
					3737, 3965, 4189, 4453, 4717, 
					5000, 5300, 5613, 5945, 6324, 
					6660, 7131, 7521, 7922, 8981, 
					9400, 10000, 10844]
	
	diff_freqs = [122, 122, 270, 150, 157, 
					166, 180, 186, 193, 215, 
					228, 224, 264, 264, 283, 
					300, 313, 332, 379, 336, 
					471, 390, 401, 1059, 419, 
					600, 844]

We're now up to 28 unique frequencies. I'm not sure if there's enough frequency space left to suggest they're using a 36 character alphabet.

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we can deduce anything new from our third set of data. The two segment start code is the same. But other than that, there doesn't seem to be any correlations I can tease out.

## Analysis

My assumption that the unique URL component was related one to one with the frequencies was wrong. It's looking more and more like there's some sort of hashing combined with error detection/correction.

It looks like I've failed to deduce the protocol, but it's interesting to see how chirp.io uses the frequency space.

I can't find the specs of the iPhone internal speaker and mic, so I don't know what the hard limits are for frequency response. But small speakers are bad at reproducing low frequencies so it makes sense that they're not going lower than 1000Hz.

The upper limit is a little more difficult to determine. It still has to do with the limit of the speaker and mic, but at a certain point, those higher frequencies may start to get a little annoying, even if the duration is short. At a certain point, due to the limitations of [human hearing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%E2%80%93Munson_curves), the higher tones wouldn't be audible enough even if they were annoying. Chirps are supposed to sound like a continuous stream of notes, and therefore even if the mic could deduce the correct frequency, it would lose some of the value.

Another one of my initial assumptions was that the amplitude of each frequency segment was not relevant. From the waveform, it looked like all segments were not of equal amplitude, but that may have been due to micing the iPhone speaker, which basically puts another 3 filters on the signal (speaker response, air, and microphone response).

The App Store description also mentions that chirping works in noisy environments, so I'm going to stick with my assumption that even relative amplitudes aren't used.

Looking at [pitch detection algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_detection_algorithm), there are three choices: Time domain,  frequency domain, or both. 

A simple time domain algorithm like period detection through zero-crossing would not work in a noisy environment, especially for higher frequencies. Autocorrelation is possible especially since we are only looking for a single frequency. Frequency domain methods are also likely because the spacing between frequencies can be chosen and there are no harmonics to worry about.

The iPhone CPUs are powerful enough now to use almost any of the popular pitch tracking algorithms and libraries, so performance shouldn't be a limiting factor.

## Conclusion

I'm looking forward to trying out the chirp.io app with some friends to see how well it performs. It's definitely a cool idea, and I'm interested to see if it picks up steam.

If you happened to have some insights about my data than I didn't, it'd be great to hear about it: [@twocentstudios](http://twitter.com/twocentstudios).

## Update

If I would have read the FAQ on chirp.io more carefully, I would have seen their post about the [technology](http://chirp.io/tech) behind chirp.io.

I was almost there… 

Let's see where we went wrong.

* 20 pure tones - got that one.
* 87.2ms each - I estimated 88ms.
* 2 tone start code - got that.
* 32 character alphabet - I first guessed 36, but then revised to saying it probably wasn't more than 30.
* [0-9, a-v] characters - I assumed they'd use up through 'z', and that it would start with letters and end with numbers.
* [startcode][shortcode][error-correction] - I'm not sure why I didn't think the shortcode would be at the front.
* Pitch detection algorithm - nothing specific is mentioned yet, although the site says they'll be publishing more on the topic soon.
* Error-correction with [Reed-Solomon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction) - I don't have enough experience with error correction algorithms that I could have made a prediction on this one. But my lack of understanding did cause me to overestimate how good the pitch detection algorithm needs to be to recover the signal.
> Error correction means that Chirp transmissions are resilient to noise. A code can be reconstituted when over 25% of it is missing or misheard.

Overall, it was a fun exercise and taught (or re-taught) me a little bit about DSP, coding & protocols, and I even got to play around with some Ruby.

I highly recommend downloading chirp.io if you've got an iOS device.
