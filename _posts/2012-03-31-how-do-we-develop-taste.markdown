This is pretty rambling, almost to the point of no TL;DR even possible. But here goes.

## What is taste?

For the sake of this discussion, taste refers to an overall awareness of the positives and negatives of a certain field of study. Anything that can be "mastered" and has some component of "art" has taste.

An easy example to start out with is a musical instrument. Let's say guitar. Someone who has never seen or heard let alone picked up a guitar would not be able to tell much of a difference between two guitar greats playing raging solos. They can't comprehend the difference. Even if they had these thoughts, they wouldn't be able to put them into words. This would be the point of no taste.

There was a brief point in my youth (5th to 8th grade) that I listened to music consistently, but did not play in band or write music in the same way the artists I listened to did. That stretch of time is the only thing I have left to remember what it was like hearing music the way non-musicians hear music. And honestly, my memory is terrible.

Since then, my taste in music has grown. Over time, I have learned the common production techniques and can zero-in on any single instrument in a multi-instrument mix pretty well. I developed tasted because I made records, and I developed taste because I played instruments in bands. In essence, I learned how to *listen* to music.

## Creating or observing?

But did I learn how to listen to music by creating music or by listening to music? I would lean towards saying that creating music had more of an effect in rapidly developing my taste than simply listening to music. Listening was still instrumental in incorporating new techniques and styles into my own developing style, so I guess it's a little bit of both.

What about the example of wine tasting? I know very little about wine tasting, but I know that lots of people love doing it. And there are plenty of critics out there that make a living or have a following simply by tasting and sharing their opinions on wine. Does a good wine critic have to have been a wine maker at some point in their career? Did they have to be a creator as well as an observer in order to develop a respected taste?

## Tastes on the web

My interests lie not only in music, but iOS and web user interfaces -- a place where tastes are plenty and often vary across the board.

My first interfaces were sloppy. I've never seen myself a designer -- my focus has always been more on the development side. But through several projects, I've gotten better, and in the meantime I've developed taste as well. I know a lot of what I like and what I don't like in user interfaces. Because I was both a creator and an observer, I think my taste has developed faster. 

Many UI/UX people often try to separate art from truth when it comes to design. In other words, trying to separate taste from absolute right and wrong. Mike Rundle has a [good post](http://flyosity.com/application-design/your-design-is-wrong-and-heres-why.php) about right and wrong in design. I'd like to focus on design aspects that are a matter of taste -- they can go either way.

Every time Facebook does a major interface overall, the backlash is always swift and unforgiving. But ultimately, the general populous (the "user base") gets used to the new design, and life goes on. Does this reaction have anything to do with taste? Can it be considered bad design simply because the "user experience" of Joe User is construed as poor for the first few weeks? If his reaction is based on an irrational opposition to change, is it bad design?

If someone with a decade of experience designing for the web, someone with arguably good taste (a good understanding of all the possibilities that could have been chosen for the design) also hates the new Facebook redesign, it's still just one vote against; the same as the one vote by Joe User. As the Facebook design leader, are you more upset by the reaction of the user base that does not have a honed taste in web design, or the web design guru?

## The purpose of taste

I ask these questions to lead up to a larger point. What is the ultimate purpose in developing taste? Is it to create a better product for the masses that consume? Is it to advance the state of the art? Is it to satisfy others in the field that have a developed taste?

My initial answer to those questions is that it depends on the field and it depends on which audience the creator is focusing on. But I've left out those that develop taste without any intention of creating. I suppose in those situations, there is either some incentive to have the domain knowledge that comes with taste, or that taste is simply a byproduct of really enjoying the associated activity.

## How do we develop taste?

Circling back around, how, then, do we develop taste? In most cases, it seems to be a mix of creating in and observing a particular field. And there has to be some component of motivation to learn. Outside critique of our creations has to play a large part in developing taste as well.
